The parameters of such oscillations depend on the sliding velocity in the contact patch. As they negatively affect the processes occurring in the electric drive and the mechanical transmission, reducing their energy efficiency, such processes can cause failures in various elements. This paper aims to conduct a theoretical study into the peculiarities of oscillatory processes in the nonlinear system and an experimental study of the auto-oscillation modes of an individual traction drive. It presents the theoretical basis used to analyze the peculiarities of oscillation processes, including their onset and course, the results of simulation mathematical modeling and the experimental studies into the oscillation phenomena in the movement of the vehicle towards the supporting base. The practical value of this study lies in the possibility to use the results in the development of algorithms for the exclusion of auto-oscillation phenomena in the development of vehicle control systems, as well as to use the auto-oscillation processes onset and course analysis methodology to design the electric drive of the driving wheels.;"[Klimov, Alexander V.; Ospanbekov, Baurzhan K.; Keller, Andrey V.; Shadrin, Sergey S.; Makarova, Daria A.; Furletov, Yury M.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Adv Engn Sch Elect Transport, Bolshaya Semyonovskaya St 38, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Klimov, Alexander V.; Ospanbekov, Baurzhan K.] Skolkovo Innovat Ctr, LLC KAMAZ Innovat Ctr, Moscow 121205, Russia; [Keller, Andrey V.; Shadrin, Sergey S.; Makarova, Daria A.] Socioctr, Tverskoy Blvd 13,Str 1, Moscow 123104, Russia";"Moscow Polytechnic University; Sociocenter";Furletov, YM (автор для корреспонденции), Moscow Polytech Univ, Adv Engn Sch Elect Transport, Bolshaya Semyonovskaya St 38, Moscow 107023, Russia.;"klimmanen@mail.ru; ospbk@mail.ru; andreikeller@rambler.ru; s.s.shadrin@mospolytech.ru; makarovadaria224hsk@yandex.com; y.m.furletov@mospolytech.ru";;;Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation;Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation;No Statement Available;;33;0;0;0;0;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;2032-6653;;;WORLD ELECTR VEHIC J;World Electr.

Z.";;;Analysis of operation models of complex technical systems;MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES;;;English;"Article; Early Access";;;;;;"Complex technical system; Metrological support; Operation model; Degradation; 78.21.35";"REMAINING USEFUL LIFE; WIND";A retrospective analysis of the existing operation models of complex technical systems is conducted. The paper describes the failure and degradation models of complex technical systems assuming monotonic and non-monotonic diffusion distributions, as well as a failure and degradation model of these systems assuming a three-parameter diffusion distribution. Failure and degradation models are proposed to be used together with the classical model of E. Sychev and more complex models created on its basis. In addition, a set of models representing the operation of complex technical systems was developed. The first model is designed for systems whose service life is fully recovered during repair and is described by a system of 21st-order linear algebraic equations, with four degrees (groups) of system degradation taken into account. A functional dependence of steady-state availability on the verification intervals of measuring instruments is plotted for complex technical systems from different degradation groups. Described by a system of 24th-order linear algebraic equations, the second operation model of complex technical systems, whose service life cannot be fully recovered during repair, enables the representation of the main stages in the lifecycle of a pool of complex technical systems, which includes pool upgrade through the procurement of new and modernization of existing systems. The developed operation models provide a means to calculate the optimal intervals between verifications and tolerances for the monitored parameters in different degradation groups of complex technical systems, thus ensuring maximum steady-state availability. These models can be used to classify complex technical systems in order to establish requirements for their metrological support, as well as to calculate technical and economic development indicators for a pool of such systems. The proposed models also provide the basis for a set of applied programs designed to model and optimize stages in its lifecycle.;"[Ershov, D. S.; Malakhov, A.

By deploying the IRS on drones, it becomes possible to improve the coverage and reliability of the communication network while reducing energy consumption and costs. Furthermore, integrating IRS with Federated Learning (FL) can further boost the performance of the drone network by enabling collaborative learning among multiple drones, leading to better and more efficient decision-making and holding great promise for enabling 6G communication networks. Therefore, we present a novel framework for FL meets IRS in drones for enabling 6G. In this framework, multiple IRS-equipped drone swarm are deployed to form a distributed wireless network, where FL techniques are used to collaborate with the learning process and optimize the reflection coefficients of each drone-IRS. This allows drone swarm to adapt to changing communication environments and improve the coverage and quality of wireless communication services. Integrating FL and IRS into drones offers several advantages over traditional wireless communication networks, including rapid deployment in emergencies or disasters, improved coverage and quality of communication services, and increased accessibility to remote areas. Finally, we highlight the challenges and opportunities of integrating FL and IRS into drones for researchers interested in drone networks. We also help drive innovation in developing 6G communication networks.;"[Shvetsov, Alexey V.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Smart Technol, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Alsamhi, Saeed Hamood; Alammari, Amr A.; Nashwan, Farhan M.

The solution of these issues was carried out during the instrumental examination of the power supply system (SES) of the enterprise based on the results of a comprehensive energy audit. An analysis was made of the dynamics of electricity consumption for 2015-2018. It has been established that the uniformity of electricity consumption for production is maintained. The average monthly electricity consumption for 2017 was: for technology - 39,637 thousand kWh; for general shop expenses (general plant) - 6942 thousand kWh; in general, for production - 46579 thousand kWh. The total electricity consumption for production by product type is presented, taking into account the auxiliary consumption of all sections for the period 2015-2017. It was found that, compared with 2015, electricity consumption in 2017 for the most energy-intensive processes for electrolytic and blister copper and decreased by 6 % and 1.5 %, respectively, at the same time, an increase in consumption was observed for the production of technical sulfur, in 2016 by 7 %, in 2017 by 15 %.

In this regard, many scientists are conducting studies on the explosiveness of the use of cutters in mines, but they are mainly aimed not at establishing the causes of methane ignition, but at improving the systems for the pressure of methane flares. The probability of methane ignition, along with other factors, depends on the reinforcement material of the mining tool, which is one of the controversial issues of Russian and foreign researchers. In this regard, studies were carried out aimed at establishing the influence of various materials reinforcing cutters on the likelihood of methane ignition during rock cutting, for which a special stand was made. The results of the experiments showed that the explosions of the methane-air mixture are determined not by the intensity of sparking of the cutter material when it wears out, but by the accumulation of thermal energy, when the critical level of which is reached, the mixture explodes. Moreover, critical energy is achieved faster when cutting rock with harder reinforcing materials.;"[Linnik, Yu. N.; Linnik, V. Yu.] State Univ Management, Moscow, Russia; [Zhabin, A.

Concentration of attention is a critical cognitive function that impacts learning. This study involved 129 healthy schoolchildren aged 8-10 years (spanning grades 2 and 3) from a regular secondary school in Kirov, Russian Federation. A physical education minute (PEM), consisting of various physical exercises, was introduced during the middle of a regular lesson for the experimental group (EG), while the control group (CG) continued with their regular studies. Concentration and attention were assessed before and after the PEM using the Bourdon test. The Bourdon test results indicated a significant decrease in concentration during the lesson for the CG (p < 0.001), while the EG exhibited significant improvement in concentration after the PEM (p < 0.001). The effect size was large, demonstrating a substantial impact of this break for physical activity on concentration. It can be concluded that implementing a set of exercises in the form of a PEM in the middle of a lesson significantly improves concentration among students aged 8-10. This study underscores the effectiveness of integrating short breaks for physical activity into the daily classroom routine, ultimately benefiting students' attention, learning, and overall educational experience.

The high-quality sheet metal obtained upon hot rolling at 400-450(degrees)C confirms the high processability of new materials. Deformation processing leads to the formation of fine sub-grain structure with a characteristic sub-grain size of 1 mu m. Very fine crystals of the Al4Ca phase particles are found at sub-grain boundaries, confirming their high pinning ability. Tensile tests of the as-wrought alloys revealed that addition of Ca in the Al-Mg alloys leads to a substantial increase in the strength properties (the ultimate tensile strength is in the 300-340 MPa range and the yield strengh is in 230-250 MPa range). Detailed analysis of various mechanisms influencing the strengthening of the new alloys revealed that contribution of sub-grain boundaries is the greatest and greatly exceeds all others: its contribution to the total YS is > 60%. Thus, addition of eutectic forming calcium in wrought Al-Mg alloys allows one to increase the strength properties through the stabilization of the sub-grain structure.;"[Akopyan, T.

The research is aimed at improving the parameters of the mechanical activation effect produced on technogenic georesources, as well as at expanding the application scope of disintegrators in the field of using the partial backfill of the mined-out space when developing stratified deposits. In this regard, the research purpose was to substantiate the parameters of extracting metals from enrichment tailings using their mechanochemical activation to ensure cyclic waste management. The research involved the application of three-dimensional interpolation methods used for processing the data and the graphical representation. As a result, the following was found to be characteristic of the waste of the Sadonsky mine management. The degree of extracting zinc from pre-activated tailings increases logarithmically when the H2SO4 concentration and the NaCl proportion decrease 3.5 times. The degree of extracting lead from the activated tailings increases according to the Fourier law when decreasing the NaCl mass concentration, and an optimal range of the H2SO4 (0.38-0.51%) proportion decreases six times. One of the key results of the research is the justification of expanding the scope of applying disintegrators in the case of a directed activation influence exerted on the components of the stowing strips. The obtained results expand the understanding of the mechanism of the influence of the mechanochemical activation of dry tailings on the reactivity unevenness when extracting several metals from them.;"[Golik, Vladimir I.; Klyuev, Roman V.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Tech & Technol Min & Oil & Gas Prod, 33 B Semenovskaya St, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Martyushev, Nikita V.] Tomsk Polytech Univ, Mat Sci Dept, 30 Lenin Ave, Tomsk 634050, Russia; [Kondratiev, Viktor V.] Russian Acad Sci, A P Vinogradov Inst Geochem, Lab Geochem Ore Format & Geochem Methods Prospecti, Siberian Branch, Irkutsk 664033, Russia; [Tynchenko, Vadim S.] Siberian Fed Univ, Sch Petr & Nat Gas Engn, Dept Technol Machines & Equipment Oil & Gas Comple, Krasnoyarsk 660041, Russia; [Tynchenko, Vadim S.] Reshetnev Siberian State Univ Sci & Technol, Inst Comp Sci & Telecommun, Informat Control Syst Dept, Krasnoyarsk 660037, Russia; [Tynchenko, Vadim S.] Bauman Moscow State Tech Univ, Artificial Intelligence Technol Sci & Educ Ctr, Moscow 105005, Russia; [Gladkikh, Vitaliy A.] Moscow State Univ Civil Engn, Stroytest Res & Testing Ctr, 26 Yaroslavskoye Shosse, Moscow 129337, Russia; [Iushkova, Liudmila V.] Siberian Fed Univ, Higher Sch Restaurant Management, Basic Dept, Krasnoyarsk 660041, Russia; [Iushkova, Liudmila V.] Minist Emergency Situat Russia, Siberian Fire & Rescue Acad State Fire Serv, Dept State & Municipal Adm, Zheleznogorsk 662972, Russia; [Brigida, Vladimir] RUDN Univ, Dept Biomed Vet & Ecol Direct, 6 Miklukho Maklaya St, Moscow 117198, Russia; [Brigida, Vladimir] Russian Acad Sci, Res Inst Comprehens Exploitat Mineral Resources, 4 Kryukovskiy Tupik, Moscow 111020, Russia";"Moscow Polytechnic University; Tomsk Polytechnic University; Russian Academy of Sciences; Siberian Federal University; Reshetnev Siberian State University of Science & Technology; Bauman Moscow State Technical University; Moscow State University of Civil Engineering; Siberian Federal University; Peoples Friendship University of Russia; Russian Academy of Sciences";Martyushev, NV (автор для корреспонденции), Tomsk Polytech Univ, Mat Sci Dept, 30 Lenin Ave, Tomsk 634050, Russia.;"v.i.golik@mail.ru; kluev-roman@rambler.ru; martjushev@tpu.ru; vadimond@mail.ru; 1z011@inbox.ru";"Klyuev, Roman/J-8000-2014; Klyuev, Roman Vladimirovich/AAX-6549-2021; Brigida, Vladimir/G-6933-2018; Martyushev, Nikita/AAO-2653-2020; Gladkikh, Vitaliy/F-1577-2017";"Klyuev, Roman/0000-0003-3777-7203; Klyuev, Roman Vladimirovich/0000-0003-3777-7203; Brigida, Vladimir/0000-0002-9421-5613; Martyushev, Nikita/0000-0003-0620-9561; Gladkikh, Vitaliy/0000-0003-1953-1584";;;;;115;0;0;0;0;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;1996-1944;;MATERIALS;Materials;NOV;2023;16;21;;;;;;;7004;10.3390/ma16217004;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ma16217004;;;17;"Chemistry, Physical; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering; Physics, Applied; Physics, Condensed Matter";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Chemistry; Materials Science; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering; Physics";X7MG7;37959601;gold;;;2023-12-25;WOS:001100241500001;View Full Record in Web of Science

The question arises about the neces-sity of applying a new direction in global science - imagology - for such research. The novelty of this study lies in being the first to examine material from a publication that has not attracted much attention from Rus-sian scholars from the perspective of this field. The relevance of the study is determined by the need to uncover a new perspective in studying the British press during wartime. The contexts of mentions about the Battle of Stalingrad in the weekly 'British Ally' are presented. It is proven that although an ad-miring attitude towards the Soviet victories at Stalingrad slips through in some articles, the publication does not give special atten-tion to the Battle of Volga. It is shown that the newspaper emphasizes the idea of the selfless resistance of the British army against Nazi Germany in Africa and Sicily, as well as their desire to open a second front. The authors conclude that the newspaper presents these events and desires as equivalent to the strug-gle of the Soviet people, which does not find approval or desired response among the news-paper's readers (the Russian people).;"[Kaygusuz, Cumhur] Samsun Ondokuz Mays Univ, Samsun, Turkiye; [Kokorina, Yulia G.; Vagabov, Makhach M.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Moscow, Russia";Moscow Polytechnic University;Kokorina, YG (автор для корреспонденции), Moscow Polytech Univ, Moscow, Russia.;"cumhurkaygusuz@gmail.com; kokorina@inbox.ru; 9162803@mail.ru";;;;;;;28;0;0;0;0;TSENTR NAUCHNYKH & OBRAZOVATELNYKH PROEKTOV;EKATERINBURG;PR-KT KOSMONAVTOV, DOM 43, KV 57, EKATERINBURG, 620098, RUSSIA;2225-756X;2227-1295;;NAUCH DIALOG;Nauch.

Within this context, Healthcare 5.0 signifies a holistic approach to healthcare delivery, where interconnected technologies enable data-driven decision-making, patient-centric care, and enhanced efficiency. This paper provides an in-depth exploration of FL's role within the framework of Healthcare 5.0 and its implications for the pandemic response. Specifically, FL offers the potential to revolutionize pandemic preparedness within Healthcare 5.0 in several vital ways: it enables collaborative learning from distributed data sources without compromising individual data privacy, facilitates decentralized decision-making by empowering local healthcare institutions to contribute to a collective knowledge pool, and enhances real-time surveillance, enabling early detection of outbreaks and informed responses. We start by laying out the concepts of FL and Healthcare 5.0, followed by an analysis of current pandemic preparedness and response mechanisms. We delve into FL's applications and case studies in healthcare, highlighting its potential benefits, including privacy protection, decentralized decision-making, and implementation challenges. By articulating how FL fits into Healthcare 5.0, we envisage future applications in a technologically integrated health system. By examining current applications and case studies of FL in healthcare, we highlight its potential benefits, including enhanced privacy protection and more effective decision support systems. Our findings demonstrate that FL can significantly improve pandemic response times and accuracy. Moreover, we speculate on the potential scenarios where FL could enhance pandemic preparedness and make healthcare more resilient. Finally, we recommend that policymakers, technologists, and educators address potential challenges and maximize the benefits of FL in Healthcare 5.0. This paper aims to contribute to the discourse on next-generation healthcare technologies, emphasizing FL's potential to shape a more resilient healthcare future.;"[Alsamhi, Saeed Hamood] IBB Univ, Fac Engn, Ibb 70270, Yemen; [Hawbani, Ammar] Univ Sci & Technol China, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Hefei, Peoples R China; [Shvetsov, Alexey V.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Smart Technol, Moscow, Russia; [Shvetsov, Alexey V.] North Eastern Fed Univ, Yakutsk, Russia; [Kumar, Santosh] IIIT Naya Raipur, Dept CSE, Uparwara, Chhattisgarh, India";"Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Science & Technology of China, CAS; Moscow Polytechnic University; North-Eastern Federal University in Yakutsk";Alsamhi, SH (автор для корреспонденции), IBB Univ, Fac Engn, Ibb 70270, Yemen.;"s.alsamhi.rs.ece@iitbhu.ac.in; anmande@ustc.edu.cn; a.shvetsov@vvsu.ru; santosh.rs.cse12@iitbhu.ac.in";Shvetsov, Alexey Vladislavovich/R-2057-2019;"Shvetsov, Alexey Vladislavovich/0000-0002-4455-0296; AL-HAWBANI, AMMAR AHMED OTHMAN/0000-0002-1069-3993; Alsamhi, Saeed/0000-0003-2857-6979";;;;;98;0;0;0;0;HINDAWI LTD;LONDON;ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND;1687-5893;1687-5907;;ADV HUM-COMPUT INTER;Adv.

Ingots of the alloy of the chosen composition and the hot and cold rolled sheets obtained from them were used as objects for the experimental study. Based on microstructural studies, it is shown that calcium binds iron into compact inclusions (presumably, into the Al10CaFe2 phases), which has a positive effect on the mechanical properties of the alloy, as well as on the technological plasticity during the rolling operation. Zirconium and scandium additives make it possible to form thermally stable nanoparticles of the Al-3(Zr, Sc)-L1(2) phase, which is favorable for maintaining a partially unrecrystallized structure in cold rolled sheets during annealing at least up to 400 degrees C. Using the alloy of the selected composition as an example, the fundamental possibility for producing sheet products from cast (unhomogenized) ingots with the properties of thermally hardenable alloys of the Al-Si-Mg-Mn and Al-Zn-(4.5)Mg-(1.5)Mn types without using quenching has been demonstrated.;"[Doroshenko, V.

To configure and digitally commission automated drives, two-mass electromechanical system models are used. A promising area in which to implement such models is the development of digital shadows, namely drive position observers. Connecting virtual models for online data exchange predetermines the tightening of requirements for their parameter calculation accuracy. Therefore, developing accessible techniques for calculating electromechanical system coordinates is an urgent problem. These parameters are most accurately defined by experiments. The contribution of this paper is the proposition of a method for defining the two-mass system model parameters using the oscillograms obtained in the operating and emergency modes. The method is developed for the horizontal stand drives of a plate mill 5000 and is supported by numerical examples. The technique is universal and comprises calculating the rotating mass inertia torques, elastic stiffness and oscillation damping coefficients, and the time constants of the motor air gap torque control loop. The obtained results have been applied to the development of the elastic torque observer of the rolling stand's electromechanical system. A satisfactory coordinate recovery accuracy has been approved for both open and closed angular gaps in mechanical joints. Recommendations are given for the use of the method in developing process parameter control algorithms based on automated drive position observers. This contributes to the development of the theory and practice of building digital control systems and the implementation of the Industry 4.0 concept in industrial companies.;"[Gasiyarov, Vadim R.; Radionov, Andrey A.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Automat & Control, 38 Bolshaya Semyonovskaya Str, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Loginov, Boris M.; Zinchenko, Mark A.] PJSC Magnitogorsk Iron & Steel Works, Cent Electrotech Lab, Magnitogorsk 455000, Russia; [Gasiyarova, Olga A.] LLC NPP Uchtekh Profi, Dept Mat Sci, 147 Kommuny Str, Chelyabinsk 454080, Russia; [Karandaev, Alexander S.; Khramshin, Vadim R.] Nosov Magnitogorsk State Tech Univ, Power Engn & Automated Syst Inst, 38 Lenin Ave, Magnitogorsk 455000, Russia";"Moscow Polytechnic University; Nosov Magnitogorsk State Technical University";Radionov, AA (автор для корреспонденции), Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Automat & Control, 38 Bolshaya Semyonovskaya Str, Moscow 107023, Russia.;"gasiyarovvr@gmail.com; radionov.mail@gmail.com; lb18@yandex.ru; aed174@mail.ru; o.ll.ja1985@gmail.com; askaran@mail.ru; hvrmgn@gmail.com";"Radionov, Andrey/P-4418-2015; Gasiyarov, Vadim/D-5003-2015";"Radionov, Andrey/0000-0002-3914-4429; Gasiyarov, Vadim/0000-0001-9635-4716";Moscow Polytechnic University;Moscow Polytechnic University;This work was financially supported by the Moscow Polytechnic University within theframework of the grant named after Pyotr Kapitsa.;;67;0;0;0;0;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;2504-4494;;J MANUF MATER PROC;J.

Since the energy intensity of the industry remains quite high, the task of rationalizing the consumption of electricity is relevant. One of the ways to improve control accuracy when planning energy costs is to forecast electrical loads. Despite the large number of scientific papers on the topic of electricity consumption forecasting, this problem remains relevant due to the changing requirements of the wholesale electricity and power market to the accuracy of forecasts. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to support management decisions in the process of planning the volume of electricity consumption. To realize this, it is necessary to create a predictive model and determine the prospective power consumption of the power system. For this purpose, the collection and analysis of initial data, their preprocessing, selection of features, creation of models, and their optimization were carried out. The created models are based on historical data on planned power consumption, power system performance (frequency), as well as meteorological data. The research methods were: ensemble methods of machine learning (random forest, gradient boosting algorithms, such as XGBoost and CatBoost) and a long short-term memory recurrent neural network model (LSTM). The models obtained as a result of the conducted studies allow creating short-term forecasts of power consumption with a fairly high precision (for a period from one day to a week). The use of models based on gradient boosting algorithms and neural network models made it possible to obtain a forecast with an error of less than 1 %, which makes it possible to recommend the models described in the paper for use in forecasting the planned electricity power consumption of united power systems.;"[Klyuev, Roman V.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Moscow, Russia; [Morgoeva, Angelika D.; Gavrina, Oksana A.; Bosikov, Igor I.; Morgoev, Irbek D.] North Caucasian Inst Min & Met State Technol Univ, Vladikavkaz, Russia";"Moscow Polytechnic University; North Caucasian Institute of Mining & Metallurgy (State Technological University)";Morgoeva, AD (автор для корреспонденции), North Caucasian Inst Min & Met State Technol Univ, Vladikavkaz, Russia.;m.angelika-m@yandex.ru;"Klyuev, Roman/J-8000-2014; Morgoeva, Angelika Dzhabrailovna/CAA-1048-2022; Klyuev, Roman Vladimirovich/AAX-6549-2021";"Klyuev, Roman/0000-0003-3777-7203; Morgoeva, Angelika Dzhabrailovna/0000-0003-2949-1993; Klyuev, Roman Vladimirovich/0000-0003-3777-7203";;;;;36;0;0;0;0;SAINT-PETERSBURG MINING UNIV;SANKT-PETERSBURG;SAINT-PETERSBURG MINING UNIV, SANKT-PETERSBURG, 00000, RUSSIA;2411-3336;2541-9404;;J MIN INST;J.

The microstructure and phase composition of the HECs were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electronic microscopy. Moreover, the mechanical properties were examined by nanoindentation. It is found that the as-prepared HEC contains the impurities of (Hf, Zr)O2 and amorphous carbon. The oxide and amorphous carbon can be in-situ removed by further carbothermal reduction reaction during the annealing, followed by dissolution of the reduction products into the HEC phase.

Disturbance of chemical signaling is accompanied by several diseases such as ischemia, trauma, and neurodegenerative diseases. It is known that the disturbance of chemical signaling, like that caused by glutamate excitotoxicity, leads to the structural reorganization of the cytoskeleton of neuronal cells and the deviation of native mechanical properties. Thus, to investigate the mechanical properties of living neuronal cells in the presence of glutamate, it is crucial to use noncontact and low-stress methods, which are the advantages of scanning ion-conductance microscopy (SICM). Moreover, a nanopipette may be used for the local delivery of small molecules as well as for a probe. In this work, SICM was used as an advanced technique for the simultaneous local delivery of glutamate and investigation of living neuronal cell morphology and mechanical behavior caused by an excitotoxic effect of glutamate.;"[Kolmogorov, Vasilii; Erofeev, Alexander; Vaneev, Alexander; Gorelkin, Petr] Natl Univ Sci & Technol MISiS, Res Lab Biophys, Moscow 119049, Russia; [Kolmogorov, Vasilii; Vaneev, Alexander; Klyachko, Natalia] Lomonosov Moscow State Univ, Fac Chem, Moscow 119991, Russia; [Gorbacheva, Lyubov] Lomonosov Moscow State Univ, Fac Biol, Moscow 119991, Russia; [Gorbacheva, Lyubov] Pirogov Russian Natl Res Med Univ, Fac Biomed, Moscow 117997, Russia; [Kolesov, Dmitry] Moscow Polytech Univ, Res Lab SPM, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Korchev, Yuri] Imperial Coll London, Dept Med, London SW7 2BX, England; [Korchev, Yuri] Kanazawa Univ, Nano Life Sci Inst WPI NanoLSI, Kanazawa 9201192, Japan";"National University of Science & Technology (MISIS); Lomonosov Moscow State University; Lomonosov Moscow State University; Pirogov Russian National Research Medical University; Moscow Polytechnic University; Imperial College London; Kanazawa University";Gorelkin, P (автор для корреспонденции), Natl Univ Sci & Technol MISiS, Res Lab Biophys, Moscow 119049, Russia.;peter.gorelkin@gmail.com;;"Vaneev, Alexander/0000-0001-8201-8498; Kolmogorov, Vasilii/0000-0002-7135-8910";"The study was performed employing a unique scientific facility Scanning ion-conductance microscope with a confocal module (registration number 2512530) and was financially supported by the Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation, Agre [2512530]; Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation [075-15-2022-264]; World Premier International Research Center Initiative (WPI) from the MEXT of Japan";"The study was performed employing a unique scientific facility Scanning ion-conductance microscope with a confocal module (registration number 2512530) and was financially supported by the Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation, Agre; Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation(Ministry of Education and Science, Russian Federation); World Premier International Research Center Initiative (WPI) from the MEXT of Japan(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT))";The study was performed employing a unique scientific facility Scanning ion-conductance microscope with a confocal module (registration number 2512530) and was financially supported by the Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation, Agreement No. 075-15-2022-264.

The simulation model was developed based on the drawn requirements while the assumptions were justified. Inertia characteristics, tire characteristics, suspension elements, grip characteristics, and surface and air resistance were considered, as these factors affect the vehicle longitudinal and transverse dynamics. The article presents the model implemented in the Labcar system and confirms its adequacy by comparing it with the data obtained during the full-scale prototype tests. The bench and range tests of a test vehicle with electric transmission equipped with a measuring complex confirmed the adequacy of the developed model.

By analyzing the works of foreign researchers, the author shows that there are several common trends in the field of paranormal experiences and belief in paranormal phenomena. The leading factors in paranormal experiences that they highlight are suggestible states and suggestibility as a psychological factor, social consensus that allows for the existence of paranormal phenomena, and the involvement of the idea of the paranormal in the overall cultural framework.

When compared to standard dose rate radiation therapy, numerous preclinical investigations have demonstrated that FL-RT provides similar benefits in conserving normal tissue while maintaining equal antitumor efficacy, a phenomenon possible due to the 'FLASH effect' (FE) of FL-RT. The methodologies involve proton radiotherapy, intensity-modulated radiation treatment, and managing high-throughput damage by radiation to solid tissues. Recent results from animal studies indicate that FL-RT can reduce radiation-induced tissue damage, significantly enhancing anticancer potency. Focusing on the potential benefits of FL proton beam treatment in the years to come, this review details the FL-RT research that has been done so far and the existing theories illuminating the FL effects. This subject remains of interest, with many issues still needing to be answered. We offer a brief review to emphasize a few of the key efforts and difficulties in moving FL radiation research forward. The existing research state of FL-RT, its affecting variables, and its different specific impacts are presented in this current review. Key topics discussed include the biochemical mechanism during FL therapy, beam sources for FL therapy, the FL effect on immunity, clinical and preclinical studies on the protective effect of FL therapy, and parameters for effective FL therapy.;"[Polevoy, Georgiy Georgievich] Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Phys Educ, Moscow, Russia; [Kumar, Devika S.] Saveetha Inst Med & Tech Sci SIMATS, Dept Res & Dev, Chennai, India; [Daripelli, Sushma] ABV Govt Degree Coll, Dept Chem, Jangaon, India; [Prasanna Sr, Muthu] Surya Grp Inst, Dept Pharmaceut Biotechnol, Vikravandi Rf, Tamil Nadu, India";Moscow Polytechnic University;Prasanna, M Sr (автор для корреспонденции), Surya Grp Inst, Dept Pharmaceut Biotechnol, Vikravandi Rf, Tamil Nadu, India.;;;S Kumar, Devika/0000-0002-4442-9197;;;;;44;0;0;5;5;SPRINGERNATURE;LONDON;CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND;;2168-8184;;CUREUS J MED SCIENCE;Cureus J Med Sci;OCT 12;2023;15;10;;;;;;;e46928;10.7759/cureus.46928;http://dx.doi.org/10.7759/cureus.46928;;;8;Medicine, General & Internal;Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI);General & Internal Medicine;U2SB9;38021805;Green Published, gold;;;2023-12-25;WOS:001083341900009;View Full Record in Web of Science

It was found that the supramolecular structure of the films is a three-dimensional network composed of orientationally ordered microfibrils with an average diameter from 30 to 60 nm, which consist of crystalline and amorphous regions. An analysis of the powder X-ray diffraction patterns demonstrated that the crystalline regions of microfibrils are formed by cellulose I. Depending on the composition of the nutrient medium, the degree of crystallinity of the films varies in the range from similar to 20 to 90%. It was found that, regardless of the carbon source, the top and bottom surfaces of BC films have different microstructures defined by static conditions of cultivation. Thus, the top surface of gel films contains pores with a diameter of up to 500 nm, whereas a wider pore size distribution (up to 600 nm) is observed on the bottom surface. The difference between the average pore sizes on the top and bottom surfaces varies from 95 to 180 nm and from 100 to 200 nm, respectively. The measurements of the mechanical properties of the films showed that the films produced by the cultivation on media containing fructose and sucrose have the maximum strength, whereas the films produced using lactose and maltose have the minimum strength.

The structure of the cast alloy mainly consists of two [(Al) + AlCaCu] and [(Al) + (Al,Cu)(4)Ca + AlCaCu] eutectics. HPT with three revolutions leads to the formation mainly of the submicrocrystalline structure, refining eutectic particles, their more homogeneous distribution in the sample bulk, segregation of calcium from AlCuCa and (Al,Cu)(4)Ca particles, and supersaturation of (Al) solid solution with copper. Such a structure causes strengthening of the alloy by three and a half times but also leads to its embrittlement. Subsequent annealing at 400 degrees C allows an adequate strength-to-plasticity balance to be reached.;"[Rogachev, S. O.; Naumova, E. A.; Tabachkova, N. Yu.; Ten, D. V.; Sundeev, R.

Crystals were grown by directed crystallization of the melt in a cold crucible. Crystals were studied by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, impedance spectroscopy, and indentation. The concentration dependences of the investigated characteristics of crystals are obtained. It has been shown that an increase in the concentration of the stabilizing oxide in all cases leads to a decrease in the amount of the transformed t-phase and reduces the value of the crack resistance of the crystals. In this case, a decrease in the size of the twins and an increase in the defectiveness of the structure are observed, which is accompanied by a slight decrease in the electrical conductivity of tetragonal solid solutions. The influence of the ionic radius of trivalent cations on the stabilization of tetragonal phases, conductivity, and the mechanical properties of crystals is discussed. An increase in the values of crack resistance and a decrease in the values of high-temperature electrical conductivity of tetragonal solid solutions in the series Y2O3 -> Gd2O3 -> Sm2O3 at comparable concentrations of stabilizing oxides were established. It has been shown that ZrO2 solid solutions stabilized with Sm2O3 can be used as functional supporting membranes in solid oxide fuel cells.;"[Agarkov, D. A.; Kuritsyna, I.

This issue is often brought up by psychologists, who directly point to the leading role of the media in the forma-tion of such representations in present-day time. The author points out the kinship of research in the field of paranormal psychology with the studies of induced phenomena by Vladimir Bekhterev, who directly pointed out the role of mass media in the formation of induced ideas. The empirical part of the work consists in the analysis of a sample of media reports on the presence of ghosts, catalogued by the author. The main research question is how the features of the localization of the ghost phenomenon stated in the media can provoke its representation. The author concludes that the media are not only conductors of paranormal ideas, as noted by other researchers, but also partially demonstrate the causal relationships underlying the formation of para-normal ideas. The author underlines the close connection between a particular location, its history and the very report of paranormal phenomena in it. The author identifies the main descriptive tech-niques of the media associated with paranormal ideas, as well as shows the specifics of their distribu-tion in the media environment. In fact, the article is intended to fill a kind of information vacuum, which has formed in the studies of ideas about the paranormal both in the Russian and foreign scien-tific environment, which makes this study very relevant.;[van Haaske, Lejonis Aanris] Moscow Polytech Univ, Moscow, Russia;Moscow Polytechnic University;van Haaske, LA (автор для корреспонденции), Moscow Polytech Univ, Moscow, Russia.;mail@vanhaaske.ru;;;;;;;37;0;0;0;0;LTD CO SCIENTIFIC INDUSTRIAL ENTERPRISE GENESIS FRONTIER SCIENCE;ASTRAKHAN;UL SAVUSHKINA D 24, KV 88, ASTRAKHAN, OBLAST, RUSSIA;;2658-7734;;GALACTICA MEDIA;Galactica Media-J.

Modern-day time-domain photometric surveys collect a lot of observations of various astronomical objects and the coming era of large-scale surveys will provide even more information on their properties. Spectroscopic follow-ups are especially crucial for transients such as supernovae and most of these objects have not been subject to such studies. Aims. Flux time series are actively used as an affordable alternative for photometric classification and characterization, for instance, peak identifications and luminosity decline estimations. However, the collected time series are multidimensional and irregularly sampled, while also containing outliers and without any well-defined systematic uncertainties. This paper presents a search for the best-performing methods to approximate the observed light curves over time and wavelength for the purpose of generating time series with regular time steps in each passband. Methods. We examined several light curve approximation methods based on neural networks such as multilayer perceptrons, Bayesian neural networks, and normalizing flows to approximate observations of a single light curve. Test datasets include simulated PLAsTiCC and real Zwicky Transient Facility Bright Transient Survey light curves of transients. Results. The tests demonstrate that even just a few observations are enough to fit the networks and improve the quality of approximation, compared to state-of-the-art models. The methods described in this work have a low computational complexity and are significantly faster than Gaussian processes. Additionally, we analyzed the performance of the approximation techniques from the perspective of further peak identification and transients classification.

As an official of the Ministry of State Property, in the 1880s, Sluchevsky accompanied the commander of the St. Petersburg Military District, Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich, on his inspection trips to the European north of Russia, its western and Baltic provinces. Sluchevsky's duties included the compilation of reports on the Grand Duke's journey, recording in them of almost every step of the high-ranking traveler and their further publication in periodicals. Despite the official nature of the publications, the materials prepared by Sluchevsky were artistic and documentary essays reflecting the life, customs and traditions of the local population, the development of industry and crafts, climatic and geographical features, history, hydrography and geology of the northwest of Russia. The article analyzes the thematic, genre and structural features of Sluchevsky's essays. The features of his texts are: dynamic storytelling, entertaining presentation, emotionality, a pronounced presence effect, a problematic approach to what was seen. Sluchevsky raised the issue of an inefficient use of the vast natural resources of the Russian northwest, pointed to the lack of support for national industry and local crafts from the state, paid considerable attention to the national question in the Baltic provinces, cited facts of discrimination of the local Orthodox Russian-speaking population by the German administration of the region. Sluchevsky's views on the problems of the Russian northwest were close to those of the influential conservative journalist Mikhail Katkov, the publisher-editor of Moscovskie Vedomosti, which contributed to Sluchevsky's publishing his essays in the newspaper. In conclusion, the article emphasizes that these essays are still of undoubted interest from a geographical, ethnographic and cultural point of view, and can serve as a valuable source of information for researchers of the history of the northwestern region.;[Perevalova, Elena V.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Journalism & Mass Commun Dept, Moscow, Russia;Moscow Polytechnic University;Perevalova, EV (автор для корреспонденции), Moscow Polytech Univ, Journalism & Mass Commun Dept, Moscow, Russia.;helenpv@yandex.ru;;;;;;;13;0;0;0;0;TOMSK STATE UNIV;TOMSK;LENIN AVE, 36, TOMSK, 634050, RUSSIA;2306-2061;2311-3774;;TEKST KNIGA KNIGOIZD;Tekst Kniga Knigoizd.;AUG;2023;32;;;;;;82;97;;10.17223/23062061/32/5;http://dx.doi.org/10.17223/23062061/32/5;;;16;Humanities, Multidisciplinary;Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI);Arts & Humanities - Other Topics;R4BS8;;;;;2023-12-25;WOS:001063823500005;View Full Record in Web of Science

There is a good agreement with the experimental data in a broad range of laser intensities from I = 10(18) W/cm(2) to I = 10(19) W/cm(2) at the fixed laser pulse duration. The obtained parameters of proton beams were used for calculation of the total yield of a particles and neutrons for the nuclear reactions B-11(p, 3a) and B-11(p, n)C-11 at the collisions of proton beams with boron targets. It is shown that the number of a particles escaping boron target and arriving at track detectors is less than 5% of the total amount of a particles, because the majority of these particles remain inside the target owing to ionization losses. The derived values of the yield of a particles' which arrive at detectors are in good agreement with the experimental data. We also calculate the total yield of neutrons in the reaction B-11(p, n)C-11. It is found that, at the intensity I = 10(19) W/cm(2) of the picosecond laser pulse, the yield is equal to N-n = 1.4 x 10(8), this value is approximately of 3% of the total yield of a particles.;"[Andreev, S.

Underground mining of rock massifs of powerful deposits on deep horizons is accompanied by geomechanical phenomena, which are prevented by the construction of artificial structures made of solid mixtures in the developed space. Controlling geomechanics of the massif increases the completeness of subsoil use and is an actual direction of mining production.Objective: detailing the array state management technology by rationally regulating the voltages in the array.Object: arrays of deposits of the Talnakh ore node.Methods: modeling and experiment, the results of which are the basis for the development of a model and recommendations.Results. The paper introduces the assessment of the behavior of natural and artificial massifs differentially for the main deposits of the ore node. The regularities of combining options for unloading arrays from critical stresses are established: with overworking and with a protec-tive layer underworking. The principles of optimization of ore mining technology taking into account the geomechanical features of the ar-rays are summarized. Measures to increase the volumetric compression of filling mixtures for variants of chamber systems of development are recommended. The results of modeling the influence of the volumes of rock inclusions on the efficiency of field development are pre-sented. A model of ecological and economic assessment of technologies is proposed, taking into account the costs of creating protective layers and reducing the dilution of ores. Unloading of arrays from stresses provides an opportunity to regulate the stress level with a de-crease in deformations, including during selective excavation of ores with the abandonment of rock layers in the bowels.Conclusions. Unloading arrays from operating stresses is an effective measure to solve the main problems of subsurface use at the same time. The implementation of this direction in the conditions of localization of the Talnakh ore deposits can be carried out by advanced ex-cavation of the soil layer. The efficiency of working out stress-deformed arrays is achieved by the rational interaction of natural and techno-logical factors of development.;"[Golik, Vladimir I.] Moscow Polytech Univ, 38 B Semenovskaya St, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Golik, Vladimir I.] Vladikavkaz Sci Ctr, Geophys Inst, 93a Markov St, Vladikavkaz 362002, Russia";"Moscow Polytechnic University; Russian Academy of Sciences; Vladikavkaz Scientific Center; Geophysical Institute, VSC RAS";"Golik, VI (автор для корреспонденции), Moscow Polytech Univ, 38 B Semenovskaya St, Moscow 107023, Russia.;Golik, VI (автор для корреспонденции), Vladikavkaz Sci Ctr, Geophys Inst, 93a Markov St, Vladikavkaz 362002, Russia.";v.i.golik@mail.ru;;;;;;;23;0;0;0;0;TOMSK POLYTECHNIC UNIV, PUBLISHING HOUSE;TOMSK;30, LENIN AVE, TOMSK, 634050, RUSSIA;2500-1019;2413-1830;;BULL TOMSK POLYTECH;Bull.

The effect of the Si- and Ca-alloying elements in aluminum on the growth process, morphology, composition, mechanical, and corrosion properties of the PEO coatings was investigated. Uniform coatings with a minimum number of defects were formed on the surfaces of Al-Ca alloys. Increasing the Si content in Al led to an increase in the bulk and surface porosity of the coatings. The & alpha;-Al2O3 phase mainly formed in the coatings synthesized on pure Al and Al-Ca alloys, while an increased amount of Si in Al alloys hindered the formation of the & alpha;-Al2O3 phase. The coatings had a microhardness of 660-1180 HV, which was 20-30 times higher than that of the original as-cast alloy. Moreover, the coating on the Al-Ca alloys had the highest peak hardness, which was probably caused by the formation of a greater amount of the & alpha;-Al2O3 phase. Electrochemical studies in 3.5% NaCl have shown that PEO coatings reduce the corrosion current density. Of all PEO-treated alloys, Al and Al1Ca have the lowest corrosion current density and hence the highest corrosion resistance due to the composition and uniformity of the coating.";"[Letyagin, Nikolay V.; Akopyan, Torgom K.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Sect Sci Act, 38 Bolshaya Semyonovskaya Str, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Letyagin, Nikolay V.; Akopyan, Torgom K.; Sokorev, Alexander A.; Sviridova, Tatiana A.; Cherkasov, Stanislav O.] Natl Univ Sci & Technol MISIS, Dept Met Forming, 4 Leninsky Pr, Moscow 119049, Russia; [Sokorev, Alexander A.] JSC Aluminum Alloys Plant, 3K Metallurgov Ave, Podolsk 142155, Russia; [Mansurov, Yulbarskhon N.] Tashkent State Transport Univ, Dept Wagons & Wagon Econ, 1 Temiryolchilar St, Tashkent 100167, Uzbekistan";"Moscow Polytechnic University; National University of Science & Technology (MISIS); Tashkent State Transport University";"Letyagin, NV (автор для корреспонденции), Moscow Polytech Univ, Sect Sci Act, 38 Bolshaya Semyonovskaya Str, Moscow 107023, Russia.;Letyagin, NV (автор для корреспонденции), Natl Univ Sci & Technol MISIS, Dept Met Forming, 4 Leninsky Pr, Moscow 119049, Russia.";"n.v.letyagin@mospolytech.ru; nemiroffandtor@yandex.ru; sokorev.a@misis.ru; tim-17@yandex.ru; ch3rkasov@gmail.com; mansurov_yulbarsxon@tstu.uz";Mansurov, Yulbarskhon Nabievich/J-8485-2016;"Mansurov, Yulbarskhon Nabievich/0000-0002-3100-4560; Akopyan, Torgom/0000-0001-9112-8584";"The authors would like to thank the JSC Aluminum Alloys Plant (JSC Aluminum Alloys Plant, 3K Metallurgov Ave., Podolsk, Moscow Oblast 142155, Russia) and, personally, the CEO Andrey G.

This study is dedicated to filling the gap in revealing the phase composition of an Al-6%Mg-2%Ca-2%Zn alloy after the combined and separate addition of Fe and Si. This was addressed by permanent mold casting and solid solution heat treatment. The investigation of slowly solidified samples also contributed to understanding potential phase transitions. It was found that the alloy containing 0.5%Fe can have nearly spherical intermetallics after heat treatment, whereas a higher Fe content brought the formation of a needle-shaped Al3Fe intermetallic. We explain this by the formation of a ternary & alpha;-Al + Al10CaFe2 + Al4Ca eutectic, which is more compact in as-cast condition compared to divorced binary & alpha;-Al + Al4Ca and & alpha;-Al + Al3Fe eutectics. Similarly, 0.5%Si readily incurred the formation of a needle-shaped Al2CaSi2 intermetallic, probably also by a binary reaction L & RARR; & alpha;-Al + Al2CaSi2. In the solidified samples, no Mg2Si phase was found, even in slowly solidified samples. This is contrary to the thermodynamic calculation, which suggests a peritectic reaction L + Al2CaSi2 Mg2Si. Interestingly, the addition of 0.5%Si caused an even coarser microstructure compared to the addition of 1%Fe, which caused the appearance of a primary Al3Fe phase. We conclude that the new alloy is more tolerable to Fe rather than Si. Specifically, the addition of 0.5%Fe can be added while maintaining a fine morphology of the eutectic network. It was suggested that the morphology of eutectic and solid solution hardening governed the mechanical properties. The strength of the alloys containing separate 0.5%Fe (UTS = 215 & PLUSMN; 8 MPa and YS 146 & PLUSMN; 4 = MPa) and the combined 0.5%Fe and 0.5%Si additions (UTS = 195 & PLUSMN; 14 MPa and YS & PLUSMN; 1 = 139 MPa) was not compromised compared to the alloy containing 0.5%Si (UTS 201 & PLUSMN; 24 = MPa and YS = 131 & PLUSMN; 1 MPa).";"[Doroshenko, Vitali] Moscow Polytech Univ, Sect Project Act, Bolyshaya Semenovskaya Str 38, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Shurkin, Pavel] Brunel Univ London, Brunel Ctr Adv Solidificat Technol BCAST, Uxbridge UB8 3PH, Middx, England; [Sviridova, Tatyana] Natl Univ Sci & Technol MISIS, Inst New Mat & Nanotechnol, Leninsky Prospekt 4, Moscow 119049, Russia; [Fortuna, Anastasiya] Natl Univ Sci & Technol MISIS, Dept Phys Mat Sci, Leninsky Prospekt 4, Moscow 119049, Russia; [Shkaley, Ivan] Russian Acad Sci, Ishlinsky Inst Problems Mech RAS, Moscow 119526, Russia";"Moscow Polytechnic University; Brunel University; National University of Science & Technology (MISIS); National University of Science & Technology (MISIS); Russian Academy of Sciences; Ishlinsky Institute for Problems in Mechanics RAS";Doroshenko, V (автор для корреспонденции), Moscow Polytech Univ, Sect Project Act, Bolyshaya Semenovskaya Str 38, Moscow 107023, Russia.;v.doroshenko@mail.ru;"Doroshenko, Vitaly/P-7063-2017; Shurkin, Pavel/B-8310-2017";Shurkin, Pavel/0000-0003-0206-6911;"The authors are grateful to Nikolai Belov (NUST MISiS) for his valuable suggestions in the preparation of this article.

It was determined that the parameters of hatching mode affect the roughness of the lateral surface when building samples with vertical walls. It was shown that the average height of surface roughness, Rz, increases as the energy of hatching mode is intensified. A physical model was proposed to describe the effect of parameters of hatching mode on the roughness of vertical walls, which is based on the hypothesis that a melt microflow can penetrate during hatching onto the external surface of the contour.

It is found that gas-phase surface fluorination provides an increase in the wear resistance of experimental samples in all cases due to a combination of nanotexturing and chemomorphological transformations of the surface layers of the modified polymers. The significant dependence of the nanotexture on the technique and mode of modification is demonstrated using the original approaches to the quantitative characterization of the experimental samples' surfaces' scanning electron microscopy-images (formed with the scanning electron microscope). It is shown that the surface fluorination not only makes possible to significantly compensate for the increase of the friction coefficient of bulk-modified UHMWPE in comparison with the original one but also provides a nonlinear multiplicative increase in the wear resistance.;"[Doronin, Fedor A.; Rytikov, Georgy O.; Evdokimov, Andrey G.; Ruduak, Yury, V; Nazarov, Victor G.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Moscow, Russia; [Rytikov, Georgy O.] State Univ Management, Moscow, Russia; [Doronin, Fedor A.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Bolshaya Semenovskaya str 38, Moscow 107023, Russia";"Moscow Polytechnic University; State University of Management; Moscow Polytechnic University";Doronin, FA (автор для корреспонденции), Moscow Polytech Univ, Bolshaya Semenovskaya str 38, Moscow 107023, Russia.;f.a.doronin@mospolytech.ru;"Nazarov, Victor/B-2274-2014; Doronin, Fedor Alexandrovich/B-2266-2014";"Nazarov, Victor/0000-0002-7243-9739; Doronin, Fedor/0000-0002-0407-060X";"Moscow Polytechnic University; Moscow Polytechnic University";"Moscow Polytechnic University; Moscow Polytechnic University";The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The reported study was funded by Moscow Polytechnic University (Grant named after V.E.

The effect of these elements on the structure and mechanical properties of the new sheet Al2Cu1.5Mn alloy designed for Al20Cu2Mn3 dispersoids has been studied by calculations and experimental methods. The obtained data on the phase composition, microstructure, and physical and mechanical properties of the new alloy for different processing routes (including hot rolling, cold rolling, and annealing) have been compared with those for the ternary Mg- and Zn-free alloy. It has been shown that the formation of nanosized Al20Cu2Mn3 dispersoids (similar to 7 vol.%) provides for the preservation of the non-recrystallized grain structure after annealing at up to 400 degrees C (3 h), while Mg and Zn have a positive effect on the strength due to the formation of alloyed aluminum solid solution. As a result, cold-rolled sheets of the Al2Cu1.5Mn1Mg1Zn model alloy showed a substantially higher strength performance after annealing at 400 degrees C in comparison with the ternary reference alloy. In particular, the UTS is similar to 360 vs. similar to 300 MPa, and the YS is 280 vs. 230 MPa. For the example of the Al2Cu1.5Mn1Mg1Zn model alloy, it has been shown that the system is promising for designing new heat-resistant alloys as a sustainable alternative to the 2xxx alloys. The new alloy has an advantage over the commercial alloys (particularly, 2219, 2024, 2014), not only in manufacturability but also in thermal stability. The sheet production cycle for the model alloy is much shorter because the stages of homogenization, solution treatment, and water quenching are excluded.;"[Belov, Nikolay; Akopyan, Torgom; Tsydenov, Kirill; Letyagin, Nikolay; Fortuna, Anastasya] Natl Univ Sci & Technol MISiS, Dept Met Forming, 4 Leninsky Pr, Moscow 119049, Russia; [Akopyan, Torgom; Letyagin, Nikolay] Moscow Polytech Univ, Sect Sci Act, 38 Bolshaya Semyonovskaya Str, Moscow 107023, Russia";"National University of Science & Technology (MISIS); Moscow Polytechnic University";"Akopyan, T (автор для корреспонденции), Natl Univ Sci & Technol MISiS, Dept Met Forming, 4 Leninsky Pr, Moscow 119049, Russia.;Akopyan, T (автор для корреспонденции), Moscow Polytech Univ, Sect Sci Act, 38 Bolshaya Semyonovskaya Str, Moscow 107023, Russia.";"belov.na@misis.ru; akopyan.tk@misis.ru; n.v.letyagin@gmail.com";;;Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation [075-15-2021-696];Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation;The results were obtained by using the equipment of the Center for Collective Use Materials Science and Metallurgy' with the financial support of the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation (#075-15-2021-696).;;46;1;1;2;2;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;2075-4701;;METALS-BASEL;Metals;AUG;2023;13;8;;;;;;;1442;10.3390/met13081442;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/met13081442;;;20;"Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Materials Science; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering";Q3NV6;;gold;;;2023-12-25;WOS:001056626900001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Based on experimental studies using statistical methods, the paper determines the parameters of electricity consumption for individual technological and auxiliary sections of a quarry (overburden, mining of copper ore, loading from a dump of quartzites, loading from dumps of barite ore, mining of basalt stone, crushing of basalt stone). A method for predicting specific power consumption for individual technological sections of a quarry has been developed using modern software. The results of this work allow us to quickly control the power consumption at the quarry of the mining and processing plant, to predict it, and on this basis, by improving the production technology, to obtain the appropriate economic effect.

An expression is obtained for determining the critical radius of the wetting perimeter, which corresponds to the possibility of compensating the linear tension along the surface of the sphere. Here it is appropriate to draw an analogy between the dependence of surface tension on the radius of a liquid drop and the dependence of the linear tension on the curvature of the three-phase contact line. The technology for extracting gold microdispersions from ore by introducing carrier minerals into the system was tested. As carrier minerals, a rough concentrate was used, separated from the ore according to the jet flotation scheme.

The first method employed in quantum electrodynamics consists in calculating the energy of the electron placed in a constant magnetic field, the extra energy due to the field being proportional to the magnetic moment. It is also possible to use the second method proceeding from the fact that the asymptotic form of the vector potential at infinity is proportional to the magnetic moment. If the electron were point-like, both the methods would yield identical results. In the present paper is studied the magnetic field created by the electron in hydrogen-like ions, which enables one to find the electron magnetic moment by the second method. The electron magnetic moment in this case proves to be different in different states of the electron in the Coulomb field of the ions and, moreover, is distinct from the magnetic moment calculated by the first method. The results of the paper show that the electron is not small and is deformable under action of external fields.;[Golovko, V.

First, with a discussion of the recent developments in FL and indoor smart device networks and their integration, we present a thorough assessment of the growing applications of FL in indoor networks. Next, we investigate and evaluate FL's potential for allowing various indoor applications and services, such as data sharing, localization, navigation, human activity recognition, and security and privacy. FL in numerous critical indoor services and applications, including smart manufacturing, smart homes, and smart healthcare, is then thoroughly discussed.

However, due to the openness and vulnerability of wireless networks, the participating vehicles in a VANET system are prone to a variety of cyberattacks. To secure the privacy of vehicles and assure the authenticity, integrity, and nonrepudiation of messages, numerous signature schemes have been employed in the literature on VANETs. The majority of these solutions, however, are either not fully secured or entail high computational costs. To address the above issues and to enable secure communication between the vehicle and the roadside unit (RSU), we propose a certificateless aggregate signature (CLAS) scheme based on hyperelliptic curve cryptography (HECC). This scheme enables participating vehicles to share their identities with trusted authorities via an open wireless channel without revealing their identities to unauthorized participants. Another advantage of this approach is its capacity to release the partial private key to participating devices via an open wireless channel while keeping its identity secret from any other third parties. A provable security analysis through the random oracle model (ROM), which relies on the hyperelliptic curve discrete logarithm problem, is performed, and we have proven that the proposed scheme is unforgeable against Type 1 (??????(1)) and Type 2 (??????(2)) forgers. The proposed scheme is compared with relevant schemes in terms of computational cost and communication overhead, and the results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is more efficient than the existing schemes in maintaining high-security levels.;"[Iqbal, Asad; Zubair, Muhammad; Ur-Rehman, Ghani] Khushal Khan Khattak Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Karak 27200, Pakistan; [Khan, Muhammad Asghar; Ullah, Insaf] Hamdard Univ, Fac Engn Sci & Technol, Islamabad 44000, Pakistan; [Shvetsov, Alexey V.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Smart Technol, St Bolshaya Semenovskaya 38, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Shvetsov, Alexey V.] North Eastern Fed Univ, Dept Car Transport Operat & Car Serv, St Belinsky 58, Yakutsk 677000, Russia; [Noor, Fazal] Islamic Univ Madinah, Dept Comp & Informat Syst, Madinah 400411, Saudi Arabia";"Hamdard University; Moscow Polytechnic University; North-Eastern Federal University in Yakutsk; Islamic University of Al Madinah";"Shvetsov, AV (автор для корреспонденции), Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Smart Technol, St Bolshaya Semenovskaya 38, Moscow 107023, Russia.;Shvetsov, AV (автор для корреспонденции), North Eastern Fed Univ, Dept Car Transport Operat & Car Serv, St Belinsky 58, Yakutsk 677000, Russia.;Noor, F (автор для корреспонденции), Islamic Univ Madinah, Dept Comp & Informat Syst, Madinah 400411, Saudi Arabia.";"asadiqbal628@gmail.com; dr.muhammadzubair@kkkuk.edu.pk; m.asghar@hamdard.edu.pk; insaf.ullah@hamdard.edu.pk; ghani.rehman@kkkuk.edu.pk; a.shvetsov@vvsu.ru; mfnoor@iu.edu.sa";Shvetsov, Alexey Vladislavovich/R-2057-2019;"Shvetsov, Alexey Vladislavovich/0000-0002-4455-0296; Zubair, Muhammad/0000-0001-6723-5486; Khan, Muhammad Asghar/0000-0002-1351-898X";;;;;33;1;1;0;0;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;1999-5903;;FUTURE INTERNET;Future Internet;AUG;2023;15;8;;;;;;;266;10.3390/fi15080266;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fi15080266;;;16;Computer Science, Information Systems;Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI);Computer Science;Q3DT0;;gold;;;2023-12-25;WOS:001056358900001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Hot deformation was carried out by the uniaxial compression of cylindrical specimens on a Gleeble 3800 thermomechanical simulator. A dependence is obtained for calculating the kinetics of austenite grain growth for a temperature range of 1150-1250 ?. The proposed dependence makes it possible to evaluate grain growth under non-isothermal conditions. The verification of the adequacy of the proposed dependence and the method for calculating the grain size at cooling rates 0.2, 1 and 5 ?/s showed its high convergence. The difference between the calculated and experimental grain size did not exceed 8%. The suppression of grain growth is due to the precipitation of titanium carbides and carbonitrides.

However, the behavior, oxidation mechanisms, and factors defin-ing oxidation resistance of some popular HECs at high temperatures have not been studied in detail yet. In this study, the oxidation behavior of MEC and HECs including (Ta,Ti,Nb,Zr)C, (Ta,Ti,Nb,Zr,Mo)C, (Ta,Ti, Nb,Zr,Hf)C, and (Ta,Ti,Nb,Zr,W)C was investigated under both non-isothermal and isothermal conditions at temperatures up to 1200 & DEG;C, and a possible oxidation path was described. It was found that under non-isothermal heating conditions, the oxidation of HECs occurred in three stages, each governed by first-order chemical reactions, and was limited by the formation of ZrO2, Me2Me6O17, and MeMe2O7 oxides, respectively. In the case of isothermal heating, the oxidation of (Ta,Ti,Nb,Zr)C, (Ta,Ti,Nb,Zr,Mo)C, and (Ta,Ti,Nb,Zr,Hf)C follows a logarithmic law and was limited by the formation of a protective Me2Me6O17 layer. In contrast, isothermal oxidation of (Ta,Ti,Nb,Zr,W)C followed a linear law due to the formation of volatile WO3. The results of the study have a high potential for practical application for the production of HEC ceramics for various high-temperature purposes and could be used for further understanding of functional characteristics and development of the new ceramic compositions.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

The use of complementary x-ray diffraction and analysis of neutron diffraction patterns by the Rietveld method allowed reliably separating the nuclear and magnetic contributions to the intensity of the diffraction peaks and performing refinement of the Fe3Ge magnetic state characteristics. Both main phases appearing in Fe3Ge are ferromagnetic with T-C = 629 K (hexagonal, D0(19)) and T-C = 714 K (cubic, L-12). In D0(19), the presence of a spin-flip transition (T-sf = 385 K) was confirmed and the temperature dependence of the components of magnetic moment along the hexagonal axis and in the basal plane was obtained. It was shown that the transformation between ordered L1(2) and D0(19) structural states, predicted by the equilibrium-phase diagram, includes three steps: two diffusional stages (L1(2) -> A1, A3 -> D0(19)) and one displacive stage (A1 -> A3). The obtained structural data suggest that in Fe-Ge, as well as in Fe-Ga alloy, direct transitions between ordered phases are impossible.

It is shown that thin films of the studied dyes 1-3 can be used in the technology of optical limitation of laser radiation, demonstrating a good cutting efficiency of dangerous nanosecond pulses.;"[Kazak, Alexandr, V; Usol'tseva, Nadezhda, V] Ivanovo State Univ, Nanomat Res Inst, Ermak St 39, Ivanovo 153025, Russia; [Kazak, Alexandr, V] Moscow Polytech Univ, Bolshaya Semenovskaya St 38, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Nikitin, Konstantin S.] Russian Acad Sci, GA Krestov Inst Solut Chem, Akademicheskaya St 1, Ivanovo 153045, Russia; [Marchenkova, Margarita A.] Shubnikov Inst Crystallog Fed Sci Res Ctr Crystall, Leninskii Pr 59, Moscow 119333, Russia; [Marchenkova, Margarita A.] Natl Res Ctr Kurchatov Inst, Academika Kurchatova Sq 1, Moscow 123182, Russia; [Savelyev, Mikhail S.; Vasilevsky, Pavel N.; Gerasimenko, Alexander Yu.] Natl Res Univ Elect Technol MIET, Shokin Sq, Zelenograd 124498, Moscow, Russia; [Savelyev, Mikhail S.; Gerasimenko, Alexander Yu.] IM Sechenov First Moscow State Med Univ, Bolshaya Pirogovskaya St,Bld 2-4, Moscow 119991, Russia; [Savelyev, Mikhail S.; Vasilevsky, Pavel N.; Tolbin, Alexander Yu.] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Physiol Act Cpds Fed Res Ctr Problems Chem Ph, Chernogolovka 142432, Russia; [Chausov, Denis N.] Russian Acad Sci, Prokhorov Gen Phys Inst, Vavilova St 38, Moscow 119991, Russia; [Chausov, Denis N.] Moscow Univ Ind & Finance Synergy, Leningrad Pr 80, Moscow 125190, Russia; [Kholodkov, Igor, V] Ivanovo State Univ Chem & Technol, Inst Macroheterocycl Cpds, Sheremetevsky Av 7, Ivanovo 153000, Russia";"Ivanovo State University; Moscow Polytechnic University; Russian Academy of Sciences; G.

Pooling medical data into a centralized storage system to train a robust ML model, on the other hand, poses privacy, ownership, and regulatory challenges. Federated learning (FL) overcomes the prior problems with a centralized aggregator server and a shared global model. However, there are two technical challenges: 1) FL members need to be motivated to contribute their time and effort and 2) the centralized FL server may not accurately aggregate the global model. Therefore, combining the blockchain and FL can overcome these issues and provide high-level security and privacy for smart healthcare in a decentralized fashion. This study integrates two emerging technologies, blockchain and FL, for healthcare. We describe how blockchain-based FL plays a fundamental role in improving competent healthcare, where edge nodes manage the blockchain to avoid a single point of failure, while IoMT devices employ FL to use dispersed clinical data fully. We discuss the benefits and limitations of combining both technologies based on a content analysis approach. We emphasize three main research streams based on a systematic analysis of blockchain-empowered: 1) IoMT; 2) electronic health records (EHRs) and electronic medical records (EMRs) management; and 3) digital healthcare systems (internal consortium/secure alerting). In addition, we present a novel conceptual framework of blockchain-enabled FL for the digital healthcare environment.

The article aims at proposing practical measures for the state support of tourism activities in Russia in the context of the COVID-19 consequences and financial constraints on business. The study considers the measures taken in different countries to promote the development of domestic tourism in a pandemic. Based on an expert survey, state support measures for the development of domestic tourism are proposed as the most sustainable socio-economic model of tourism in the context of the post-COVID restrictions and imposed sanctions.

The object of study is a wall with FHIC, on the outer surface of which temperature sensors were mounted and measurements were taken. Air temperatures were also measured for one month of the warm period of the year. The coefficient of absorption of solar radiation by the surface of the facade is calculated based on the measurement of the spectral reflection coefficient. Measurements of direct and scattered solar radiation arriving on a horizontal surface were carried out, and the cloudiness of the sky was also recorded. The calculation of direct and scattered solar radiation was carried out, taking into account the shading of surrounding buildings using the authors' novel methods. The experimental days were divided into three groups according to the degree of cloudiness; statistically significant differences between the groups for the studied parameters were demonstrated. The temperature of the outer surface of the wall was calculated according to A.M. Shklover's formula. The measured values of the temperature of the outer surface of the wall were compared with the calculated ones. It was shown that there is a good correlation between the measured and calculated temperatures for different degrees of cloudiness. At the same time, for days with no or slight cloudiness (Group I), when direct solar radiation predominates, the differences reach 1.7 & DEG;C; smaller differences are observed for days with average cloudiness (Group II) during daytime hours, with a maximum difference of 0.5 & DEG;C; and on days with continuous cloudiness (Group III), when only scattered radiation is present for daytime hours, the maximum difference is 0.3 & DEG;C. Statistically significant differences were found between the measured and calculated temperatures for groups of days, divided by the degree of cloudiness, for the experimental period of a day from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., which indicates the possibility of considering amendments to A.M. Shklover's formula for sunny days. The results of comparing the measured and calculated heating temperatures of the facade surface also indirectly confirm the correctness of the author's calculations of the incoming solar radiation, taking into account the effect of the surrounding buildings. The results obtained can be used to study the inertia and durability of building structures under solar radiation.";"[Korkina, Elena V.; Gorbarenko, Ekaterina V.] Russian Acad Architecture & Construct Sci, Res Inst Bldg Phys, 21 Lokomotivny Proezd, Moscow 127238, Russia; [Korkina, Elena V.; Tyulenev, Matvey D.] Moscow State Univ Civil Engn, Dept Heat & Gas Supply & Ventilat, 26 Yaroslavskoe shosse, Moscow 129337, Russia; [Gorbarenko, Ekaterina V.] Lomonosov Moscow State Univ, Fac Geog, 1 Leninskie Gori, Moscow 119234, Russia; [Voitovich, Elena V.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Ind & Civil Engn, 38 Bolshaya Semyonovskaya St, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Kozhukhova, Natalia I.] Belgorod State Technol Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Mat Technol, 46 Kostukov, Belgorod 308012, Russia";"Moscow State University of Civil Engineering; Lomonosov Moscow State University; Moscow Polytechnic University; Belgorod State Technological University";Kozhukhova, NI (автор для корреспонденции), Belgorod State Technol Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Mat Technol, 46 Kostukov, Belgorod 308012, Russia.;"elena.v.korkina@gmail.com; tulenevm@gmail.com; e.voitovich@mail.ru; catgor@mail.ru; kozhuhovanata@yandex.ru";Kozhukhova, Natalia/F-8804-2015;Kozhukhova, Natalia/0000-0002-9380-0968;;;;;21;0;0;0;0;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;1996-1073;;ENERGIES;Energies;AUG;2023;16;15;;;;;;;5783;10.3390/en16155783;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en16155783;;;11;Energy & Fuels;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Energy & Fuels;O8HF1;;gold;;;2023-12-25;WOS:001046156300001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Terminological work, both in the world and in Russian science, was carried out, first of all, on the material of exact and technical disciplines. Arrangement of terminology of humanitarian knowledge has been in the focus of attention of researchers only in recent years. Thus, the aim of the work is to study the terminological system of historical knowledge by means of parametric analysis of the little-known course by V.O. Klyuchevsky Terminology of Russian History, which was first published in 1956 and practically was not studied by either historians or linguists, and this substantiates the novelty of the present work. Materials and Methods. The material of this course, studied with the help of historical-comparative, historical-typological, as well as general scientific methods such as analysis and synthesis, using parametric analysis and positional statistics, showed that the terminology proposed by V.O. Kluchevsky has a systemic nature and its structure is hierarchical. Nine parameters - archaeological, geographical, terminological, illustrative, source study, classification, chronological, economic, etymological - were singled out in the work. A conditional notion of the place of each parameter in the so-called dictionary article, which is determined by the boundary of the two parameters, was introduced. The notion of a dictionary article as applied to the course materials is conditional, since the course is not a dictionary proper. Analysis. Using statistical methods, the frequency of occurrence of each parameter in a certain place in each of the three parts of the course is identified. Statistical tables are formed, which make it possible to see the similarity and difference between the three parts of the course and to point out their features. This article traces not only the scientist's fluency in ancient and modern languages, including rare ones, but also the ability to use linguistic techniques, such as historical-etymological and word-formation analysis, on the material of the Terminology of Russian History. Results. The semantic invariant in the construction of the parts of the course has been revealed. This is an additional evidence of the systematic nature of the historical terminology, which was suggested by V.O. Klyuchevsky. The hierarchical nature of the system of terms, created in the course by V.O. Klyuchevsky, has been determined. Contribution of the authors.

The article aims at tracing the evolution of scientific thinking as a phenomenon of technogenic civilization from scientific and technological thinking to informational one in the context of asserting the authority of useful knowledge based on mathematical evidence, formal logic, and the achievements of modern science. The study was conducted in 2022 using qualitative data collection methods. The study shows that the formation of technogenic civilization is due to the influence of scientific and technological thinking, whose emergence is caused by the requirements of modern reality, where the cultural and humanitarian spheres give way to scientific and technological. Scientific and technological thinking conditions the development of information and computer technologies that generate informational thinking. It is concluded that science is the base and means of systematizing natural and social reality. It causes the emergence and development of engineering and technology. On their basis, scientific and technological thinking is formed, whose philosophical and methodological foundation is rationalism. The transformation of scientific and technological thinking in the process of social changes leads to the emergence of informational thinking, which is the result of the development of information and digital technologies and appears as a mode of scientific and technological thinking.;"[Kotlyarova, Victoria] Inst Serv & Entrepreneurship branch DSTU Shakhty, Shakhty, Russia; [Isakova, Gulizar] Dagestan State Univ, Makhachkala, Russia; [Vaslavskaya, Irina] Kazan Volga Fed Univ, Naberezhnye Chelny Inst, Kazan, Russia; [Gorlova, Olga] Moscow Polytech Univ, Moscow, Russia; [Putrik, Iurii] Russian Heritage Inst, Moscow, Russia; [Molochnikov, Nikolaj] Kuban State Univ, Krasnodar, Russia";"Dagestan State University; Kazan Federal University; Moscow Polytechnic University; Kuban State University";Kotlyarova, V (автор для корреспонденции), Inst Serv & Entrepreneurship branch DSTU Shakhty, Shakhty, Russia.;"biktoria66@mail.ru; gulizarisakova@mail.ru; vaslavskaya@yandex.ru; business007@bk.ru; putrik@list.ru; mnr001@mail.ru";"Kotlyarova, Victoria Валентиновна/O-7686-2014; Горлова, Ольга/AAA-9900-2021; VASLAVSKAYA, IRINA YU/V-6995-2017";"Kotlyarova, Victoria Валентиновна/0000-0001-6419-6119; Горлова, Ольга/0000-0001-7108-2769; VASLAVSKAYA, IRINA YU/0000-0002-1363-3865";;;;;38;0;0;4;4;UNIV CATOLICA PETROPOLIS;PETROPOLIS;UNIV CATOLICA PETROPOLIS, PETROPOLIS, 00000, BRAZIL;1678-6785;1984-6754;;SYNESIS;Synesis;OCT-DEC;2023;15;4;;;;;;;e2741;;;;;13;Philosophy;Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI);Philosophy;O6LT6;;;;;2023-12-25;WOS:001044907500010;View Full Record in Web of Science

One way to solve these problems is to develop original packaging with protection elements and labeling against counterfeiting, which excludes the possibility of replication and forgery by printing or other methods. The most reliable way to protect packaging from counterfeiting is the use of new materials with unique optical properties and constantly updated technologies for packaging manufacturing and labeling. This paper proposes a new multi-level technology for the design, manufacture and hidden labeling of polymer packaging made from several layers of transparent polymer films. The design and marking of the multilayer films are combined with perforation, thermal treatment and heat sealing of the package. The reliability of the proposed markings is based on the characterization of optical pleochroism effects in transparent multilayer polymer materials with shape memory. The thermomechanical and optical properties of films made of bulk thermoplastics (polypropylene, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride and polyethylene) were characterized in polarized light. The modification and combination of these films provide a high color difference and sufficient contrast of hidden markings, allowing to identify genuine products by bar codes formed from shape memory films in sealing seams of flexible polymer packaging.;"[Kondratov, Alexander P.; Nikolaev, Alexander A.; Nazarov, Victor G.; Vereshchagin, Vladislav Y.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Incognit Technol, Moscow, Russia; [Volinsky, Alex A.] Univ S Florida, Dept Mech Engn, Tampa, FL USA; [Volinsky, Alex A.] Univ S Florida, Dept Mech Engn, 4202 E Fowler Ave ENG030, Tampa, FL 33620 USA";"Moscow Polytechnic University; State University System of Florida; University of South Florida; State University System of Florida; University of South Florida";Volinsky, AA (автор для корреспонденции), Univ S Florida, Dept Mech Engn, 4202 E Fowler Ave ENG030, Tampa, FL 33620 USA.;volinsky@usf.edu;"Vereshchagin, Vladislav/G-3817-2018; Nazarov, Victor/B-2274-2014; Nikolaev, Alexander/AHB-3757-2022";"Vereshchagin, Vladislav/0000-0002-1344-4888; Nazarov, Victor/0000-0002-7243-9739; Nikolaev, Alexander/0000-0003-3232-6753; Volinsky, Alex/0000-0002-8520-6248";Moscow Polytechnic University;Moscow Polytechnic University;This work was supported by the Moscow Polytechnic University within the grant named after Vladimir Fortov.;;60;0;0;16;16;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0021-8995;1097-4628;;J APPL POLYM SCI;J.

Recent studies have demonstrated the superior quality of solutions based on various machine learning models. These models learn to classify supernova types using their light curves as inputs. Preprocessing these curves is a crucial step that significantly affects the final quality. In this talk, we study the application of multilayer perceptron (MLP), bayesian neural network (BNN), and normalizing flows (NF) to approximate observations for a single light curve. We use these approximations as inputs for supernovae classification models and demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform the state-of-the-art based on Gaussian processes applying to the Zwicky Transient Facility Bright Transient Survey light curves. MLP demonstrates similar quality as Gaussian processes and speed increase. Normalizing Flows exceeds Gaussian processes in terms of approximation quality as well.;"[Demianenko, Mariia; Derkach, Denis; Hushchyn, Mikhail] HSE Univ, 20 Myasnitskaya Ulitsa, Moscow 101000, Russia; [Malanchev, Konstantin] Lomonosov Moscow State Univ, Sternberg Astron Inst, Univ Sky Pr 13, Moscow 119234, Russia; [Demianenko, Mariia; Sysak, Mikhail] Moscow Inst Phys & Technol, Inst Skii Pereulok 9, Dolgoprudnyi 141700, Moscow Region, Russia; [Samorodova, Ekaterina] Lomonosov Moscow State Univ, Fac Space Res, Leninskiye Gory 1,Bldg 52, Moscow 119234, Russia; [Shiriaev, Aleksandr] Moscow Polytech Univ, Tverskaya St 11, Moscow 125993, Russia; [Malanchev, Konstantin] Univ Illinois, Dept Astron, 1002 West Green St, Urbana, IL 61801 USA";"HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics); Lomonosov Moscow State University; Moscow Institute of Physics & Technology; Lomonosov Moscow State University; Moscow Polytechnic University; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign";Hushchyn, M (автор для корреспонденции), HSE Univ, 20 Myasnitskaya Ulitsa, Moscow 101000, Russia.;mhushchyn@hse.ru;;Demianenko, Mariia/0000-0002-8297-6386;"RFBR; CNRS [21-52-15024]; Academic Fund Program at the HSE University in 2022 [22-00-025]";"RFBR(Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR)); CNRS(Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)); Academic Fund Program at the HSE University in 2022";KM work on data preparation is supported by the RFBR and CNRS according to the research project.21-52-15024.

Welding conditions were achieved via design of experiment (DOE), and the Box-Behnken design (BBD) method was selected. Welding time, welding current and electrode pressure were recorded as input parameters, while maximum displacement, peak load and failure energy of the welded samples accomplished from tensile shear tests were outputs. The influence of the welding current is superior to the influence of the welding time on the increase of the weld strength as stated by the analysis of variations (ANOVA). Relatively high welding heat input conditions enhance the mechanical attributes of the welds by increasing the nugget size. The largest mechanical properties obtained under the optimum welding conditions are welding time of 14 cycles, welding current of 10.8 kA and electrode force of 0.4 MPa. By verifying the regression models of the optimal welding conditions, the experimental results of the welded specimens with the maximum mechanical properties are about maximum displacement of 2.69 mm, peak load of 11.10 kN and failure energy of 23.90 J. The results show that the proposed spot weld strength models have an estimated accuracy of 5.32%. Due to the complete growth of austenite grains, the martensite in the coarse grain heat-affected zone (CGHAZ) is much larger than that of other zones, while in the HAZ at the side of BH steel, other phases besides martensite are also spotted, such as bainite, Widmanstatten ferrite and grain boundary ferrite. This is because BH steel has a lower carbon content. All welded specimens display hardening in the fine grain heat-affected zone (FGHAZ).;"[Zhao, Dawei; Vdonin, Nikita] South Ural State Univ, Dept Welding Engn, Chelyabinsk 454080, Russia; [Radionova, Lyudmila] Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Met, Bolshaya Semyonovskaya St 38, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Glebov, Lev] South Ural State Univ, Dept Met Forming, Chelyabinsk 454080, Russia; [Guseinov, Kirill] South Ural State Univ, Dept Engn Mech, Chelyabinsk 454080, Russia";"South Ural State University; Moscow Polytechnic University; South Ural State University; South Ural State University";Zhao, DW (автор для корреспонденции), South Ural State Univ, Dept Welding Engn, Chelyabinsk 454080, Russia.;zhaodawei0322@xy.hfut.edu.cn;"Glebov, Lev/JLL-8177-2023; Zhao, Dawei/AAU-9928-2020";Zhao, Dawei/0000-0002-3865-2958;Russian Science Foundation [2229-20095];Russian Science Foundation(Russian Science Foundation (RSF));The authors wish to thank the Russian Science Foundation (22-29-20095) for funding.;;25;0;0;7;7;SPRINGER LONDON LTD;LONDON;236 GRAYS INN RD, 6TH FLOOR, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND;0268-3768;1433-3015;;INT J ADV MANUF TECH;Int.

The article systematizes various models of regional tourism clusters depending on the distribution of roles, areas of interaction, the impact of integration, and the stages of the cluster life cycle: a non-core cluster, an axial cluster, a satellite cluster, and a regulated cluster. Authors concluded that due to the crisis caused by the pandemic, sanctions, and trade wars, the role of regulated tourist clusters in Russia will only increase since these clusters are more stable due to state support. In relation to external restrictions on outbound tourism, the state will focus on the development of domestic tourism while regulating the activities of tourism clusters. In this case, new projects of large-sized tourism businesses will be aimed not to obtain economic benefits but rather to demonstrate their loyalty to the existing government. On the contrary, businesses will rely on subsidies and economic support from the state.;"[Dukhovnaya, Liliya] Russian State Univ Tourism & Serv, Moscow, Russia; [Sayenko, Maria] Moscow Acad Entrepreneurship, Moscow, Russia; [Zenin, Sergey] Univ Tyumen, Inst State & Law, Tyumen, Russia; [Kryukova, Elena] Russian State Social Univ, Moscow, Russia; [Sekerin, Vladimir] Moscow Polytech Univ, Moscow, Russia; [Sinyukov, Vasily] Khabarovsk State Univ Econ & Law, Khabarovsk, Russia";"Russian State University of Tourism & Service; Tyumen State University; Russian State Social University (RSSU); Moscow Polytechnic University";Dukhovnaya, L (автор для корреспонденции), Russian State Univ Tourism & Serv, Moscow, Russia.;"6199900@mail.ru; 6199900@mail.ru; mariya-saenko@yandex.ru; lena-krukova@yandex.ru; bcintermarket@yandex.ru; v.sinukov@yandex.ru";Kryukova, Elena/P-2786-2015;Kryukova, Elena/0000-0002-3734-7206;Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation [075-01603-22-01];Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation;This article was prepared as part of the implementation of the state task of the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation No. 075-01603-22-01 dated 18.01.2022 FSMW-2020-0030 Transformation of Russian Law in the Conditions of Big Challenges: Theoretical and Applied Foundations.;;27;0;0;2;2;UNIV FEDERAL JUIZ FORA, CAMPUS UNIV;JUIZ DE FORA;CEP 36036-330, JUIZ DE FORA, MG 00000, BRAZIL;2238-2925;;;AN BRAS ESTUD TURIST;An.

The results of tensile testing of the samples of such strips are presented, which made it possible to determine the deformation resistance (yield strength), ultimate tensile strength, and percent elongation before and after rolling with a percent reduction of the cross-section area of & epsilon; = 10-30%. Based on the obtained data, curves were constructed that allowed us to establish quantitative trends in the variations of metal deformation resistance (yield strength) (& sigma;(s)), ultimate tensile strength (& sigma;(t)), and percent elongation (& delta;) depending on the degree of deformation of copper M0. It is shown that the ultimate tensile strength (& sigma;(t)) and yield strength & sigma;(0.2) (& sigma;(s)) increase with different intensity as the percent reduction increases. The & sigma;(t) parameter demonstrates a slow linear monotonic increase from 221 to 315 MPa as the percent reduction changes from 0 to 30%; while & sigma;(0.2) (& sigma;(s)) increases intensively according to the parabolic law from 41 to 308 MPa. The ductility index decreases from 63 to 16% within this deformation range. Regression equations have been obtained for calculating the basic mechanical properties of copper M0 during the process of cold rolling at various reductions. The adequacy of the obtained equations, confirmed by high correlation coefficient values (R-2 > 0.9), makes it possible to recommend them for calculating the power characteristics of the rolling process, as well as for use in the automated design (CAD) systems to determine the rational copper strips (M0) deformation conditions at the industrial sheet rolling mills.";"[Shatalov, R.

A fire is extinguished better when the right type of fire retardant is used. A thumb rule on firefighting also says, never fight a fire if you do not know what is burning. In this paper, we have proposed an Intelligent Decision Support System (ID2S4FH) to generate a real-time 'fire-map' of such SDCs during a fire hazard. We have interfaced six tin-oxide-based gas sensor elements, a temperature and humidity sensor, and a particulate matter (PM) sensor with microcontrollers to capture the real-time signature patterns of the ambient air. We burned sixteen different types of materials belonging to six classes of fire and created a dataset consisting of 2400 samples. The sensor array responses were then pre-processed and analysed using various classifiers trained in different analysis space domains. Among the classifiers, four classifiers achieved 'all correct' identification of the fire classes of 80 unknown test samples, and the lowest mean squared error (MSE) achieved was 2.81 x 10(-3). During a fire hazard, our proposed ID2S4FH can generate real-time fire maps of SDCs and help firefighters to extinguish the fire using the appropriate fire retardant.;"[Kumar, Kanak; Rajput, Navin Singh] Indian Inst Technol BHU, Dept Elect Engn, Varanasi 221005, India; [Shvetsov, Alexey V.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Smart Technol, St Bolshaya Semenovskaya 38, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Shvetsov, Alexey V.] North Eastern Fed Univ, Fac Transport, St Belinsky 58, Yakutsk 677000, Russia; [Saif, Abdu] Taiz Univ, Fac Engn & IT, Dept Commun & Comp Engn, POB 6803, Taizi, Yemen; [Sahal, Radhya] Univ Coll Cork, Sch Comp Sci & IT, Cork T12 K8AF, Ireland; [Sahal, Radhya] Hodeidah Univ, Fac Comp Sci & Engn, POB 3114, Al Hodeidah, Yemen; [Alsamhi, Saeed Hamood] IBB Univ, Fac Engn, POB 70270, Ibb, Yemen";"Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology BHU Varanasi (IIT BHU Varanasi); Moscow Polytechnic University; North-Eastern Federal University in Yakutsk; Taiz University; University College Cork; Hodeidah University";Rajput, NS (автор для корреспонденции), Indian Inst Technol BHU, Dept Elect Engn, Varanasi 221005, India.;"kanakkumar.rs.ece18@iitbhu.ac.in; nsrajput.ece@iitbhu.ac.in; a.shvetsov@vvsu.ru; abduh.saif2017@siswa.um.edu.my; rsahal@ucc.ie; s.alsamhi.rs.ece@iitbhu.ac.in";Shvetsov, Alexey Vladislavovich/R-2057-2019;"Shvetsov, Alexey Vladislavovich/0000-0002-4455-0296; Sahal, Radhya/0000-0002-8019-9069; Alsamhi, Saeed/0000-0003-2857-6979";;;;;30;0;0;1;1;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;2571-6255;;;FIRE-BASEL;Fire-Switzerland;JUL;2023;6;7;;;;;;;248;10.3390/fire6070248;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fire6070248;;;21;"Ecology; Forestry";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry";N3KS4;;gold;;;2023-12-25;WOS:001036048300001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Carbon-based electrodes, with their characteristic high specific power and good cyclic stability, can be used for a new generation of consumer electronics, biomedical devices and hybrid electric vehicles. However, most carbon materials, due to their low electrical conductivity and insufficient diffusion of electrolyte ions in complex micropores, have energy density limitations in these devices due to insufficient number of pores for electrolyte diffusion. This work focuses on the optimization of a hybrid material based on porous carbon and carbon nanotubes by mechanical mixing. The purpose of this work is to gain new knowledge about the effect of hybrid material composition on its specific capacitance. The material for the study is taken on the basis of porous carbon and carbon nanotubes. Electrodes made of this hybrid material were taken as an object of research. Porous carbon or nitrogen-containing porous carbon (combined with single-, double-, or multi-layer carbon nanotubes (single-layer carbon nanotubes, bilayer carbon nanotubes or multilayer carbon nanotubes) were used to create the hybrid material. The effect of catalytic chemical vapor deposition synthesis parameters, such as flow rate and methane-to-hydrogen ratio, as well as the type of catalytic system on the multilayer carbon nanotubes structure was investigated. Two types of catalysts based on Mo12O28 (& mu;(2)-OH)(12){Co(H2O)(3)}(4) were prepared for the synthesis of multilayer carbon nanotubes by precipitation and combustion. The resulting carbon materials were tested as electrodes for supercapacitors and lithium ion intercalation. Electrodes based on nitrogen-containing porous carbon/carbon nanotubes 95:5% were found to be the most efficient compared to nitrogen-doped porous carbon by 10%. Carbon nanotubes, bilayer carbon nanotubes and multilayer carbon nanotubes synthesized using the catalyst obtained by deposition were selected as additives for the hybrid material. The hybrid materials were obtained by mechanical mixing and dispersion in an aqueous solution followed by lyophilization to remove water.

Currently, the Programmed Pulse Pattern PWM (PPWM) technique is used extensively that allows pre-eliminating the selected harmonics from the converter's voltage and current spectrum or reducing them to meet the voltage quality standard requirements. A review of scientific publications has shown the insufficiency of available studies on defining and estimating the impact of powerful converters with PPWM. The problem of defining the amplitudes of higher harmonics generated by a converter with PPWM, which are the main cause of electronic equipment failures at the common grid connection point, is particularly relevant. This study considers the behavior of the NPC converter voltage and current spectra at PPWM with the selected harmonic elimination (SHE) for three-level (3L) voltage waveforms. The behavior of up to the 50th non-eliminated harmonics in the NPC converter voltage and current spectra is first shown for a modulation factor changing within 0-1.15 at the pitch of 0.01 for six different SHE PPWM: no. 1-5 and 7; no. 2-5, 7, 11, and 13; no. 3-5, 7, 11, 13, 17, and 19; no. 4-5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 25; no. 5-5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 25; 29, and 31; no. 6-5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 25, 29, 31, 35, and 37. The concept proposed herein allows measuring the current consumed amplitudes of NPC converter with SHE PPWM at the low average error of about 6%. The adequacy of the approach used herein to determine the current harmonic amplitudes has been experimentally verified with laboratory equipment. The results are consistent with engineering accuracy. The research work is promising for further study and estimation of the impact of the NPC converter SHE PPWM for more complex multi-pulse grid connection circuits and resonance phenomena.";"[Maklakov, Aleksandr S.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Project Act Ctr, Sci Act Sect, Bolshaya Semyonovskaya St 38, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Erdakov, Ivan N.] South Ural State Univ, Inst Engn & Technol, Lenin Prospect 76, Chelyabinsk 454080, Russia";"Moscow Polytechnic University; South Ural State University";Erdakov, IN (автор для корреспонденции), South Ural State Univ, Inst Engn & Technol, Lenin Prospect 76, Chelyabinsk 454080, Russia.;"a.s.maklakov@mospolytech.ru; erdakovin@susu.ru";"; Maklakov, Alexander/K-1365-2015";"Erdakov, Ivan/0000-0003-2005-4439; Maklakov, Alexander/0000-0001-7950-708X";;;;;32;0;0;0;0;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;1996-1073;;ENERGIES;Energies;JUL;2023;16;13;;;;;;;5183;10.3390/en16135183;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en16135183;;;16;Energy & Fuels;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Energy & Fuels;M2NQ0;;gold;;;2023-12-25;WOS:001028603500001;View Full Record in Web of Science

It is discovered that there are significant differences in the experimental data on temperature modes obtained by many authors. A new dynamic method of measurement of overheating temperature in the active region of p-n structures at pre-set direct current is applied. This method is based on registration of the transient processes of direct voltage changes during heating by pre-set current and cooling-down after switching-off of the heating current at constant low direct current. The formula is obtained for calculation of the proportion factor of direct-voltage temperature dependence for diodes with different techno structures accounting for the measurement current, the non-ideality factor of the voltage-current curve, and temperature. The experimental curves of the LED active region temperature dependence on heating current at its density of (10-110) A/cm(2) and dissipated power of (0.025-0.45) W are obtained. The direct-voltage temperature dependence proportion factor was modelled at different values of measurement current for specific LEDs. It is demonstrated that the active region of LEDs based on wide-band-gap semiconductors overheats due to formation of hot charge carriers interacting with optic phonons in it at current densities, when the exponential nature of the voltage-current curve is disturbed.;"[Varlamov, Dmitry O.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Elect Equipment & Ind Elect Subdept, Moscow, Russia; [Manyakhin, Feodor I.] Natl Univ Sci & Technol MISIS, Automat Design Subdept, Moscow, Russia; [Skvortsov, Arkady A.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Moscow, Russia";"Moscow Polytechnic University; National University of Science & Technology (MISIS); Moscow Polytechnic University";Manyakhin, FI (автор для корреспонденции), Natl Univ Sci & Technol MISIS, Automat Design Subdept, Moscow, Russia.;zaomisis@yandex.ru;;;;;;;21;0;0;0;0;ZNACK PUBLISHING HOUSE;MOSCOW;PO BOX 648, 10100 MOSCOW, RUSSIA;0236-2945;;;LIGHT ENG;Light Eng.;;2023;31;3;;;;;91;99;;10.33383/2022-048;http://dx.doi.org/10.33383/2022-048;;;9;"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Optics";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Engineering; Optics";K7PB7;;;;;2023-12-25;WOS:001018311300011;View Full Record in Web of Science

The floating layers were modeled and the geometric characteristics of molecular packings on water surface were calculated. It was shown that the area per molecule in the dense face-on packing of a monolayer is 1.69 nm2, and in the edge-on packing - 0.90 nm2. Analysis of the floating layer compression isotherm revealed that ZnTPP molecules are arranged face-on to the interface plane. Electron absorption spectroscopy showed that LS-films contain aggregates of J-type. The surface morphology of LS-films studied by AFM revealed that the average roughness of LS-films increases by 1.4 times with an increase in the number of transfers from one to five. The sensing properties of the LS-films (with 15 transfers) with respect to hydroxypyridine and pyridine in aqueous and gaseous media, correspondingly, have been studied.

RESULTS: It has been investigated how magnesium oxide and cerium oxide interact to affect the crystal structure, morphology and microstructure of the materials produced. It was assumed that CeO2 forms on the surface of MgO while the material's developed surface is preserved. The values of the specific surface area and average pore diameter of the studied samples depend on the composition and vary in the ranges of 16-41 m(2) g(-1) and 11.919 nm, respectively. CONCLUSION: It has been established that the sizes of CeO2 crystallites in the composition of nanocomposites change insignificantly and range from 6.5 to 7.4 nm. The photocatalytic activity of the studied samples is at least two times higher compared to analogs. The samples MgO-CeO2 (30 mol%) and MgO-CeO2 (50 mol%) showed the maximum photodegradation efficiency of acid telon blue and direct bright blue dyes at levels of 98.5% and 92.5%, respectively.

In addition, diesel power plants require regular maintenance, have a relatively short service life during continuous operation and produce a large amount of emissions into the environment. This article discusses various methods of placing solar panels in the space for the autonomous power supply of weather station equipment. The principles of these methods are described and their advantages and disadvantages are outlined. The optimal algorithms of functioning for photomodules are described and their comparison regarding the main, significant parameters is carried out. The choice of the most effective algorithm for use at a weather station is made. The effective positioning of solar panels is also calculated, and positioning conditions are determined depending on the territorial location and various environmental conditions. Simulation of the power supply system of a weather station consisting of solar panels, batteries and inverters is performed. As a result, a practical example of the application of the method of selecting the optimal composition of equipment for a hybrid power system of a weather station territorially located in Siberia with different configurations of equipment is considered. In numerical terms, it was possible to reduce the cost of power equipment operation by more than 60% with a fairly low payback period of 5.5 years and an increased reliability of the power system, which is very important for autonomous power systems of northern weather stations.;"[Malozyomov, Boris V.

Thus, more spheres of private life are entering a digital environment. Devoid of physical limitations, it develops and functions according to its own rules. First of all, the research subject is relevant since modern digital communications pose a real threat to privacy protection. The relevant litigation practice was analyzed using the methods of document analysis and content analysis. The authors of the article selected criminal cases related to violations of privacy that courts of first instance considered in the period 2021-2022 and judgments on privacy protection in Western jurisprudence. The authors conclude that traditional legal means and tools are not enough to solve privacy issues in the modern world. It is necessary to develop legal mechanisms to prevent the invasion of privacy, as well as clear criteria for possible interference in private life and its limitations.

This study aims at analyzing the international experience of regulating cryptocurrencies to introduce them into financial systems. Using the methods of document analysis and expert survey, the authors of the article explain the nature of cryptocurrency, the reasons for its emergence, and the possibility of its regulation. Based on international experience, the authors determine the main models for regulating cryptocurrencies by national legislation. The authors prove that a significant number of people prefer using cryptocurrencies as a means of payment and digital financial assets over traditional (fiat) money. The use of cryptocurrencies poses a problem in implementing the state financial policy. This is conditioned by conflicting goals and objectives of the state policy, which does not allow recognizing cryptocurrencies as monetary units of account and means of interstate payments. The article dwells on the possibility of resolving these contradictions since this will have to be done in the future. The main trend in the regulation of cryptocurrencies is an approach where their prohibition is an ineffective and even socially dangerous mechanism.

This article is devoted to the consideration of the views of the outstanding Russian historian I.E. Zabelin on the role of the concept of nationality and folk life in relation to archaeology. The task of reconstructing the scientist's ideas related to determining the place of archeology in the life of society and the nature of science is solved on the basis of unpublished archival materials. In the course of the study, new accents were placed in his assessment as an archaeologist, teacher, citizen, what is the novelty of this work. The materials of this study were handwritten lecture notes compiled by E.I. Zabelin in the 1860s, for reading in front of an audience consisting of artists, as well as diaries and autobiography of the scientist. In historiography, the work of I.E. Zabelin was not considered in the perspective chosen in this article. In his lectures, I.E. Zabelin argues that modern ideas can be realized only by referring to the heroic past of the people. By nationality in archaeology, a scientist understands the study of both the material and spiritual culture of the past. Based on the history of archeology, the researcher points out the need to study not only classical antiquities, but also monuments of other peoples. Innovative are his reflections on the & DLANGBRAC;living & drangbrac; and dead ways of developing archaeology as a science. The development of archaeological knowledge in Russia, for reasons not always of an academic nature, followed a dead path, which led to small-scale, regional -chronological isolation, and emphasized the empirical nature of research. The thesis of the unity of historical and archaeological knowledge has entered into the tradition of Russian science. I.E. Zabelin in his lectures was repeatedly ahead of his time, justifying the use of the term type of archeology, advocating a combination of archaeological practice and theory, defending the need to study all aspects of folk life.

Zabelin;BYLYE GODY;;;English;Article;;;;;;"history of higher education in Russia; teaching of archeology; I; E; Zabelin; archaeological theory; history of archeology; Konstantinovsky Boundary Institute";;I.E. Zabelin (1820-1908) is known as an outstanding historian and archaeologist, but as a teacher of the Russian higher school he is much less known. In this work, the program of the course Russian history in connection with archaeology, stored in the archive of the scientist, is introduced into scientific circulation. Ivan Egorovich gave lectures on historical disciplines to students of the Konstantinovsky Boundary Institute from 1853 to 1865. Turning to the experience of teaching archaeology accumulated by Russian pedagogy opens up a way for modern archaeological education to get out of the state of crisis in which it is located. The identification of I.E. Zabelin's civic position through the prism of his reflections on teaching history and archeology to young people, the clarification of the scientist's contribution to the methodology and didactics of historical disciplines is fundamentally new. The concept of teaching archaeology, which was developed and applied by I.E. Zabelin, has not been considered in detail in the literature. I.E. Zabelin introduces into his course a new study of folk folklore as a source for that time, introduces students to an innovative approach to the study of Slavic settlements, developed by Z. Khodakovsky. The example of the course program shows that I.E. Zabelin was ahead of his time more than once. He grouped ancient artifacts by material and purpose, introduced listeners to the technology of antiquities production. An undoubted contribution to the theory of archaeology is the presentation of archaeology as a historical discipline, which has firmly entered the Russian scientific tradition. I.E. Zabelin was a talented teacher, turned to historical and material sources to create his course, used the principle of clarity in teaching. He saw the task of archeology in studying the life of the people, instilled in students a love of reading scientific literature, working with ancient artifacts, attention to the destinies and ideals of his people. The pupils appreciated and loved their teacher. Awareness of the humanistic orientation of archaeology, reliance in teaching on the whole range of sources, a high civic position are important for the archaeological education of the XXI century.;"[Kokorina, Yulia G.; Vagabov, Machach M.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Moscow, Russia; [Khanbalaeva, Sabina N.] MGIMO Univ, Moscow State Inst Int Relat, Moscow, Russia; [Abdullayev, Utkir I.] Urgench State Univ, Urgench, Uzbekistan";"Moscow Polytechnic University; MGIMO University; Urgench State University";Kokorina, YG (автор для корреспонденции), Moscow Polytech Univ, Moscow, Russia.;"kokorina@inbox.ru; sabinamgimo@mail.ru; abdullayev.u.i@mail.ru; 9162803@mail.ru";"Vagabov, Makhach/ABE-8346-2021; KOKORINA, Julia Georgievna/C-1481-2018; Abdullayev, Utkir/JCB-8003-2023";"Vagabov, Makhach/0000-0002-6949-9490;";;;;;43;0;0;0;0;Cherkas Global Univ Press;Washington;1717 N Street NW, Suite 1, Washington, District of Columbia, UNITED STATES;2073-9745;2310-0028;;BYLYE GODY;Bylye Gody;JUN;2023;18;2;;;;;650;661;;10.13187/bg.2023.2.650;http://dx.doi.org/10.13187/bg.2023.2.650;;;12;History;Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI);History;K2ZS7;;gold;;;2023-12-25;WOS:001015179000012;View Full Record in Web of Science

A high building density, a large number of vehicles, and industrial enterprises negatively affect both the air quality in the city itself and the climate in general, releasing a significant amount of carbon dioxide. In this regard, there is a need not only to revise the structure of urban developments and strategies for their greening, but also to propose new technologies that radically change the ecological situation. In this paper, solutions using phototrophic microorganisms are considered as such a technology. It is shown that photobioreactors for their cultivation can be successfully integrated into urban systems, while in addition to air purification, the problem of surface wastewater treatment for their further use can also be solved. A wide range of products obtained from the biomass of phototrophic microorganisms significantly increases the economic attractiveness of this approach. Modern technologies in the field of the Internet of Things make it possible to successfully integrate photobioreactors into the urban digital environment.;"[Gotovtsev, P. M.; Gorin, K.

Ageeva presents the family correspondence of the Ufa mayor A.A. Malleev and studies his biography. The epistolary finding and the specific historical context of the story introduce different as-pects of the history of urban administration and the everyday life of the provincial nobility in the late 19th - early 20th centuries. The book has become an original contribution to regional historiography, and its author has revised some of the conclusions of his predecessors, based on a metahistorical narrative. Information about the origin and genea-logical relations of the family surname sheds light on the formation of the official elite in the eastern provinces as a result of the industrial development of the region in the 18th century and the reforms of local government and the court system in the post-reform period. The epistolary material recreates a portrait of personal qualities of the mod-ernizers and testifies to the formation of new personnel in the provinces - the carriers of a genuine democratic cul-ture. The author analyzes the influence of ethical views of officials on managerial decision-making as a central prob- lem poorly developed in institutional history. The author traced it on the example of the events of the 1905 revolu-tionary crisis in Ufa. The discourse of private correspondence contains a lot of valuable evidence on the family life of the Malleevs, their religious identity and methods of raising children, on cultural and everyday life of the urban elite of a provincial town. The style and spelling of the letters, as well as the turns of phrase and the accepted spelling of certain words at that time, have remained unchanged, which increases the value of the source.

For continuous monitoring of the well drilling process, an experimental setup was developed that operates on the basis of the use of the phase-metric method of control. Any movement of the bit causes a change in the electrical characteristics of the probing signal. To obtain a stable signal from a bit immersion depth of up to 250 m, a frequency of probing electrical signals of 166 Hz and an amplitude of up to 500 V were used; sampling rate (analog-to-digital converter) ADC - 10101 Hz. To identify the state of the drill string and the bit according to the graphs of dependences of changes in the electrical characteristics of the probing signal on time, the authors of the article investigated a number of deep learning methods, based on the results of the research, a line of capsule neural network (CapsNet) methods was selected.

Therefore, this study aimed to present a framework depicting the dynamic interaction of AB, RT, LE, S-A, and TTA. Specifically, 394 EFL students from Turkey were given the Academic Buoyancy Scale (ABS), the Reflective Thinking Questionnaire (RTQ), the Test-Taking Anxiety Scale (TTAS), the Core of Self-Assessment Questionnaire (CSAQ), and the Foreign Language Enjoyment Scale (FLES). Higher levels of S-A, AB, RT, and LE were associated with more S-A and less TTA among EFL students, as shown by confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and structural equation modeling (SEM).

Such membrane lifetime testing is critical to the operation of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). The crystals were obtained by the method of directional crystallization of the melt in a cold crucible.

Since the Internet serves as the key hub for connection and data sharing, its open nature presents security and privacy concerns and should be considered when integrating this technology into the current global healthcare system. Cybercriminals target the TMIS because it holds a lot of sensitive patient data, including medical records, personal information, and financial information. As a result, when developing a trustworthy TMIS, strict security procedures are required to deal with these concerns. Several researchers have proposed smart card-based mutual authentication methods to prevent such security attacks, indicating that this will be the preferred method for TMIS security with the IoT. In the existing literature, such methods are typically developed using computationally expensive procedures, such as bilinear pairing, elliptic curve operations, etc., which are unsuitable for biomedical devices with limited resources. Using the concept of hyperelliptic curve cryptography (HECC), we propose a new solution: a smart card-based two-factor mutual authentication scheme. In this new scheme, HECC's finest properties, such as compact parameters and key sizes, are utilized to enhance the real-time performance of an IoT-based TMIS system. The results of a security analysis indicate that the newly contributed scheme is resistant to a wide variety of cryptographic attacks. A comparison of computation and communication costs demonstrates that the proposed scheme is more cost-effective than existing schemes.;"[Khan, Muhammad Asghar; Ullah, Insaf] Hamdard Univ, Hamdard Inst Engn & Technol, Dept Elect Engn, Islamabad 44000, Pakistan; [Alhakami, Hosam] Umm Al Qura Univ, Coll Comp & Informat Syst, Dept Comp Sci, Mecca 21955, Saudi Arabia; [Alhakami, Wajdi] Taif Univ, Coll Comp & Informat Technol, Dept Informat Technol, Taif 21431, Saudi Arabia; [Shvetsov, Alexey V.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Smart Technol, St Bolshaya Semenovskaya 38, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Shvetsov, Alexey V.] North Eastern Fed Univ, Fac Transport, St Belinsky 58, Yakutsk 677000, Russia";"Hamdard University; Umm Al Qura University; Taif University; Moscow Polytechnic University; North-Eastern Federal University in Yakutsk";Khan, MA (автор для корреспонденции), Hamdard Univ, Hamdard Inst Engn & Technol, Dept Elect Engn, Islamabad 44000, Pakistan.;"m.asghar@hamdard.edu.pk; hhhakam@uqu.edu.sa; whakami@tu.edu.sa; a.shvetsov@vvsu.ru; insaf.ullah@hamdard.edu.pk";"Khan, Muhammad Asghar/AAT-3860-2020; Shvetsov, Alexey Vladislavovich/R-2057-2019";"Khan, Muhammad Asghar/0000-0002-1351-898X; Shvetsov, Alexey Vladislavovich/0000-0002-4455-0296; Alhakami, Hosam/0000-0002-4908-5573; Alhakami, Wajdi/0000-0003-1230-9470";;;;;28;0;0;3;3;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;1424-8220;;SENSORS-BASEL;Sensors;JUN;2023;23;12;;;;;;;5419;10.3390/s23125419;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s23125419;;;15;"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation";K3XI0;37420585;Green Accepted, Green Published, gold;;;2023-12-25;WOS:001015797100001;View Full Record in Web of Science

The dangers and threats are becoming more interdependent. Society needs to not only introduce advanced technologies and respond to the challenges of environmental hazards in time but also create legal fail -safes to ensure environmental security. The present study aims to analyze constitutional and legal norms for the provision of environmental security and directions for their improvement. Based on an analysis of legislation and legal literature, the paper defines constitutional and legal provisions of environmental security and analyzes the provisions of the Russian Constitution that act as a legal base for the development, adoption, and implementation of the legal norms to ensure the country's environmental security. Proceeding from an expert survey, proposals are formulated for improving constitutional norms by making them environmentally friendly to better ensure environmental security.

Two different scanning strategies were used: the convenient single laser exposure scanning strategy and the newly proposed double scanning strategy aimed at improving the melting process and increasing the density of the synthesized material. Samples with a relative density value higher than 95% were obtained using the new scanning strategy by reducing void volume and cracks. This was achieved by decreasing internal stresses and reducing the tendency to form and propagate cracks. The double scanning strategy of half laser power followed by full power exposure provides higher magnetic properties (both coercive force and remanence). The coercive force increases with energy input decrease, while remanence has inverse dependence.;"[Pelevin, Ivan A.; Terekhin, Egor A.; Ozherelkov, Dmitry Yu.; Tereshina, Irina S.; Chernyshikhin, Stanislav V.; Gromov, Alexander A.] Natl Univ Sci & Technol, Catalysis Lab, MISIS, Moscow 119991, Russia; [Tereshina, Irina S.] Lomonosov Moscow State Univ, Fac Phys, Moscow 119991, Russia; [Karpenkov, Dmitry Yu.] Lomonosov Moscow State Univ, Dept Magnetism, Moscow 119991, Russia; [Bochkanov, Fedor Yu.] Natl Univ Sci & Technol, MISIS, Dept Funct Nanosyst & High Temp Mat, Moscow 119991, Russia; [Chernyshikhin, Stanislav V.] Skolkovo Inst Sci & Technol, Ctr Mat Technol, Moscow 121205, Russia; [Nalivaiko, Anton Yu.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Directorate Sci, Moscow 107023, Russia";"National University of Science & Technology (MISIS); Lomonosov Moscow State University; Lomonosov Moscow State University; National University of Science & Technology (MISIS); Skolkovo Institute of Science & Technology; Moscow Polytechnic University";Pelevin, IA (автор для корреспонденции), Natl Univ Sci & Technol, Catalysis Lab, MISIS, Moscow 119991, Russia.;"i.pelevin@misis.ru; terehinegor2016@gmail.com; d.ozherelkov@gmail.com; irina_tereshina@mail.ru; karpenkov_d_y@mail.ru; bochkanov_fy@mail.ru; stanislav.chernyshikhin@skoltech.ru; a.y.nalivajko@mospolytech.ru; a.gromov@misis.ru";"Ozherelkov, Dmitriy/G-6720-2014; Gromov, Alexander/N-1673-2014; Karpenkov, Dmitriy/H-6473-2014";"Ozherelkov, Dmitriy/0000-0003-1553-4526; Gromov, Alexander/0000-0002-2641-2607; Pelevin, Ivan/0000-0003-1592-3062; Tereshina, Irina/0000-0003-3633-3440; Chernyshikhin, Stanislav/0000-0001-7419-9604; Karpenkov, Dmitriy/0000-0001-8686-2303";Russian Science Foundation (RSF) [21-79-10239];Russian Science Foundation (RSF)(Russian Science Foundation (RSF));This research was funded by the Russian Science Foundation (RSF), grant number 21-79-10239.;;37;0;0;4;4;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;2075-4701;;METALS-BASEL;Metals;JUN;2023;13;6;;;;;;;1084;10.3390/met13061084;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/met13061084;;;16;"Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Materials Science; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering";K6IF7;;gold;;;2023-12-25;WOS:001017450100001;View Full Record in Web of Science

The indisputable impact of digitalization on the transformation of the world economy and the relations existing in it must be assessed from two sides of consideration: as changes in the procedure of international exchange and as the course of development of the unity of the economies of the world countries. Modern research extensively examines and evaluates the impact of digitalization on corporate governance, isolated industries, the transformation of society, economy, and management in specific world states. According to experts, the current stage of digitalization will contribute to the increasing pace of information exchange. However, this probably will not significantly affect the scaling of commodity trade between countries. In addition to the above, digitalization can lead to the minimization of capital flows between states. However, it predetermines the introduction of advanced technologies that transform operating systems and, collectively, the economy of the world through the complete or partial replacement of human labor (advanced analysis, artificial intelligence, mobile gadgets, robots, communication devices, technological platforms).;"[Bank, Sergey] MIREA Russian Technol Univ, Moscow, Russia; [Sekerin, Vladimir] Moscow Polytech Univ, Moscow, Russia; [Gurtskoy, Lev] Rostov State Med Univ, Rostov Na Donu, Russia; [Bryzgalov, Denis] Financial Univ Govt Russian Federat, Moscow, Russia; [Zadornov, Konstantin] Kosygin State Univ Russia, Moscow, Russia";"MIREA - Russian Technological University; Moscow Polytechnic University; Rostov State Medical University; Financial University Under the Government of Russian Federation; Kosygin State University of Russia";Bank, S (автор для корреспонденции), MIREA Russian Technol Univ, Moscow, Russia.;;;;;;;;20;0;0;2;2;FUNDACAO PEDRO LEOPOLDO;PEDRO LEOPOLDO;AV LINCOLN DIOGO VIANA 830, PEDRO LEOPOLDO, MG 33600-000, BRAZIL;1677-9479;2177-6652;;REV GEST TECNOL;Rev.

This requires improving techniques for estimating the transformer's health and forecasting its remaining useful life (RUL). A brief review of the problem being solved has shown that the known RUL estimation techniques include processing the results of measuring the facility state parameters using various mathematical methods. Data processing techniques (deep learning, SOLA, etc.) are used, but there is no information on their application in online monitoring systems. Herewith, fast (shock) changes in the resource caused by the failures and subsequent recoveries of the facility's health have not been considered. This reduces the RUL forecasting accuracy for the repairable equipment, including transformers. It is especially relevant to consider the impact of sudden state changes when it comes to furnace transformers due to a cumulative wear effect determined by their frequent connections to the grid (up to 100 times a day). The proposed approach is based on calculating the RUL by analytical dependencies, considering the failures and recoveries of the facility state. For the first time, an engineering RUL forecasting technique has been developed, based on the online diagnostic monitoring data results provided in the form of time series. The equipment's relative failure tolerance index, calculated with analytical dependencies, has first been used in RUL forecasting. As a generalized indicator, a relative failure tolerance index considering the facility's state change dynamics has been proposed. The application of the RUL forecasting technique based on the results of dissolved gas analysis of a ladle furnace unit's transformer is demonstrated. The changes in the transformer state during the operation period from 2014 to 2022 have been studied. The RUL was calculated in the intensive aging interval; the winding dismantling results were demonstrated, which confirmed developing destructive processes in the insulation. The key practical result of the study is reducing accidents and increasing the service life of the arc and ladle furnace transformers. The techno-economic effect aims to ensure process continuity and increase the metallurgical enterprise's output (we cannot quantify this effect since it depends on the performance of a particular enterprise). It is recommended to use the technique to forecast the RUL of repairable facilities equipped with online monitoring systems.";"[Radionov, Andrey A.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Automat & Control, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Liubimov, Ivan V.] South Ural State Univ, Dept Elect Drive & Mechatron, Chelyabinsk 454080, Russia; [Yachikov, Igor M.] South Ural State Univ, Dept Informat Measuring Equipment, Chelyabinsk 454080, Russia; [Abdulveleev, Ildar R.; Khramshina, Ekaterina A.; Karandaev, Alexander S.] Nosov Magnitogorsk State Tech Univ, Power Engn & Automated Syst Inst, Magnitogorsk 455000, Russia";"Moscow Polytechnic University; South Ural State University; South Ural State University; Nosov Magnitogorsk State Technical University";Radionov, AA (автор для корреспонденции), Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Automat & Control, Moscow 107023, Russia.;"radionov.mail@gmail.com; liubimoviv@susu.ru; iachikovim@gmail.com; i.abdulveleev@magtu.ru; khramshinaea@gmail.com; askaran@mail.ru";"Abdulveleev, Ildar/H-9748-2016; Radionov, Andrey/P-4418-2015; Karandaev, Alexander Sergeevich/I-5687-2014";"Abdulveleev, Ildar/0000-0003-2748-6533; Radionov, Andrey/0000-0002-3914-4429; Khramshina, Ekaterina/0000-0002-1606-4266; Karandaev, Alexander Sergeevich/0000-0002-2671-0241";;;;;97;0;0;10;10;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;1996-1073;;ENERGIES;Energies;JUN;2023;16;12;;;;;;;4630;10.3390/en16124630;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en16124630;;;27;Energy & Fuels;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Energy & Fuels;K1OX5;;gold;;;2023-12-25;WOS:001014219300001;View Full Record in Web of Science

The effects of CeO2 addition on the crystal structure and high-temperature conductivity of the crystals have been investigated. According to X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy, it was found that Ce cations in crystals are present mainly as Ce4+ ions. The study of the grown crystals by X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy showed that all the grown crystals were single-phase and had either a tetragonal t`` or cubic structure, the latter having crystals containing 10 mol% Y2O3 and doped with CeO2. Doping of the crystals with CeO2 was accompanied by a linear increase in the lattice parameter. This indicates the entry of CeO2 into the crystal lattice with the formation of a solid solution. The study of the ionic conductivity of crystals by impedance spectroscopy in the temperature range 400-900 degrees C showed that the substitution of Zr4+ ions with Ce4+ ions manifests itself in different ways and can either increase or decrease the value of high-temperature conductivity depending on the content of stabilizing yttrium oxide.

Known problems of deep underground mining do not allow for realizing the potential of man-made gas reservoirs due to the deterioration of the conditions of development of reserves of georesources. The aim of the work was to improve recommendations for the substantiation of drilling parameters for undermined drainage boreholes for increasing methane production from unconventional coal-gas collectors. The authors' approach innovation lies in the possibility of using the established patterns of better natural stability of undermined boreholes to optimize them as spatial orientation parameters in an existing drilling passport for the improvement of methane extraction productivity. For this purpose, smoothing (LOESS) of the experimental data of two similar types of wells was used; then deterministic interpolation methods in combination with a three-dimensional representation of the response function in gnuplot were used. As a result, it was found that the increase in the inclination angle from 40 degrees to 60 degrees leads to a significant transformation of the model of the studied process, accompanied by a decline in the dynamics of methane emission and a decrease in the distance of the productive work zone of this type of well from 13 to 5 m before the roof landing, which then is replaced by a sharp increase in the productive work zone up to 35 m ahead of the longwall face. This allows under specific conditions for recommending increasing the productivity of methane capex from technogenic disturbed coal-gas reservoir replacement of wells with a smaller angle of rise to the transition to a more frequent grid of clusters from wells #4.";"[Malozyomov, Boris V.] Novosibirsk State Tech Univ, Dept Electrotech Complexes, 20,Karla Marksa Ave, Novosibirsk 630073, Russia; [Golik, Vladimir Ivanovich] Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Tech & Technol Min & Oil & Gas Prod, 38,B Semenovskaya St, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Brigida, Vladimir] RUDN Univ, Dept Biomed Vet & Ecol Direct, 6,Miklukho Maklaya St, Moscow 117198, Russia; [Brigida, Vladimir] Russian Acad Sci, Fed Res Ctr Subtrop Sci Ctr, Soci 354002, Russia; [Kukartsev, Vladislav V.] Reshetnev Siberian State Univ Sci & Technol, Inst Engn & Econ, Dept Informat Econ Syst, Krasnoyarsk 660037, Russia; [Kukartsev, Vladislav V.] Siberian Fed Univ, Inst Space & Informat Technol, Dept Informat, Krasnoyarsk 660041, Russia; [Kukartsev, Vladislav V.; Boyko, Andrey A.] Bauman Moscow State Tech Univ, Digital Mat Science New Mat & Technol, Moscow 105005, Russia; [Tynchenko, Yadviga A.] Siberian Fed Univ, Lab Biofuel Composit, Krasnoyarsk 660041, Russia; [Tynchenko, Yadviga A.] Reshetnev Siberian State Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Syst Anal & Operat Res, Krasnoyarsk 660037, Russia; [Boyko, Andrey A.] Siberian Fed Univ, Sch Petr & Nat Gas Engn, Dept Technol Machines & Equipment Oil & Gas Comple, Krasnoyarsk 660041, Russia; [Boyko, Andrey A.] Reshetnev Siberian State Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Management, Krasnoyarsk 660037, Russia; [Tynchenko, Sergey V.] Siberian Fed Univ, Inst Business Proc Management, Dept Digital Control Technol, Krasnoyarsk 660041, Russia; [Tynchenko, Sergey V.] Reshetnev Siberian State Univ Sci & Technol, Inst Comp Sci & Telecommun, Dept Comp Sci & Comp Engn, Krasnoyarsk 660037, Russia";"Novosibirsk State Technical University; Moscow Polytechnic University; Peoples Friendship University of Russia; Russian Academy of Sciences; Reshetnev Siberian State University of Science & Technology; Siberian Federal University; Bauman Moscow State Technical University; Siberian Federal University; Reshetnev Siberian State University of Science & Technology; Siberian Federal University; Reshetnev Siberian State University of Science & Technology; Siberian Federal University; Reshetnev Siberian State University of Science & Technology";Malozyomov, BV (автор для корреспонденции), Novosibirsk State Tech Univ, Dept Electrotech Complexes, 20,Karla Marksa Ave, Novosibirsk 630073, Russia.;"borisnovel@mail.ru; v.i.golik@mail.ru; 1z011@inbox.ru; vlad_saa_2000@mail.ru; t080801@yandex.ru; eboiko@sfu-kras.ru; stynchenko@sfu-kras.ru";"Malozyomov, Boris V./J-1723-2016; Kukartsev, Vladislav/U-6956-2019; Brigida, Vladimir/G-6933-2018";"Malozyomov, Boris V./0000-0001-8686-9556; Kukartsev, Vladislav/0000-0001-6382-1736; Brigida, Vladimir/0000-0002-9421-5613";state assignment research of FRC SSC RAS [FGRW-2021-0015, 122032300363-3];state assignment research of FRC SSC RAS;The study was funded by the state assignment research of FRC SSC RAS FGRW-2021-0015, project No 122032300363-3 (Brigida V., designing of the author's approach to modeling nonlinear processes).;;110;13;13;12;12;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;1996-1073;;ENERGIES;Energies;MAY 23;2023;16;11;;;;;;;4276;10.3390/en16114276;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en16114276;;;16;Energy & Fuels;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Energy & Fuels;I6VU0;;gold;;;2023-12-25;WOS:001004149900001;View Full Record in Web of Science

The influence of the synthesis temperature, the exposure time, and the density of the charge (TiO2 + ZrO2 + Nb2O5 + CaH2) on the mechanism and kinetics of the calcium hydride synthesis of the Ti-18Zr-15Nb beta-alloy was studied. Temperature and exposure time were established as crucial parameters with the help of regression analysis. Moreover, the correlation between the homogeneity of the powder obtained and the lattice microstrain of beta-Ti is shown. As a result, temperatures above 1200 degrees C and an exposure time longer than 12 h are required to obtain a Ti-18Zr-15Nb powder with a single beta-phase structure and uniformly distributed elements. The analysis of beta-phase growth kinetics revealed that the formation of beta-Ti occurs due to the solid-state diffusion interaction between Ti, Nb, and Zr under the calcium hydride reduction of TiO2 + ZrO2 + Nb2O5, and the spongy morphology of reduced alpha-Ti is inherited by the beta-phase. Thus, the results obtained provide a promising approach for manufacturing biocompatible porous implants from beta-Ti alloys that are believed to be attractive candidates for biomedical applications.

With the increase of Mn content from 0.4 wt. % to 1.2 wt. %, the volume fraction of dynamically recrystallized (DRXed) grains decreases from 89% to 40%, while the DRXed grain size decreases from 3.2 mu m to 1.9 mu m. The segregation of Mn atoms and nano alpha-Mn dynamical precipitates are observed at the grain boundaries of the extruded Mg-0.8Mn alloys and the amount of dynamically precipitates is increased with increasing Mn content. Tensile tests show that the Mn content significantly affects mechanical properties at room temperature (RT). The Mg-0.8 wt. % Mn alloy shows the excellent ductility of 81 % at room temperature in a strain rate of 1 center dot 10(-3) s(-1), the ductility decreases if the Mn content is lower or higher than 0.8 wt. %. The yield strength (YS) and ultimate tensile strength (UTS) increase with increasing Mn content. The large value of strain rate sensitivity exponent (m-value) and small activation volume (V*) of the as-extruded Mg-0.8Mn alloy suggest that grain boundary sliding (GBS) plays an important role in tensile plastic deformation. High volume fraction of the un-DRXed region leads to the reduced contribution of GBS to plastic deformation, decreases ductility at RT. The Atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis indicates that the contribution of GBS to the total plastic deformation is 2.7 %, 55.1 % and 12.8 % for Mg-0.4Mn, Mg-0.8Mn and Mg-1.2Mn alloys, respectively.;"[Li, C.

Representatives of e-commerce are major stakeholders in the development of such tools. In particular, subscription services (multiservice subscriptions) allow users to create their own ecosystems based on their personal preferences. The rate of subscription service use is growing around the world, yet understanding of the peculiarities of development of this e-commerce sphere is limited due to insufficient research. The study aims to determine the motives and barriers to the use of subscription services (multiservice subscriptions) by consumers and their relationship with consumer characteristics. Proceeding from an online survey of 200 users, the study determines the relationship between the gender and income of consumers and their use of subscription services, motives and motivators for using subscription services, and barriers to the choice of a particular subscription service. The obtained results may serve as a basis for managerial decisions in e-commerce and for improving the effectiveness of marketing solutions.;"[Gladilina, Irina; Degtev, Gennady] Moscow Metropolitan Governance Univ, Moscow, Russia; [Kochetkov, Evgeniy] Financial Univ Govt Russian Federat, Moscow, Russia; [Tretyak, Elena] Moscow Polytech Univ, Moscow, Russia; [Stepanova, Diana] Plekhanov Russian Univ Econ, Moscow, Russia; [Mutaliyeva, Lyailya] LN Gumilyov Eurasian Natl Univ, Astana, Kazakhstan";"Financial University Under the Government of Russian Federation; Moscow Polytechnic University; Plekhanov Russian University of Economics; L.N.

The tasks are formulated to achieve the goal. They involve classifying the methods of foreign language teaching based on the competency approach and identifying the effective methods. The methodological basis of this research includes methods of analyzing the practical experience of foreign language teaching based on a competency-based approach, synthesis of national and international experience, comparison of national models of the language environment, and generalization of sociological data. As a result of the conducted research, it has been revealed that among various methods, approaches related to information and communication technologies [ICT] are utilized most often. We believe that when teachers conduct courses using synchronous computer-mediated communication [SCMC] tools or platforms, students should be given opportunities to express their opinions. Most teachers recognize the creation of instructional videos as the most effective. According to the students, this type of activity also has the greatest learning effect and stimulates creativity. The scientific novelty of the research is the study of foreign language teaching methods based on a competency-based approach within the framework of online distance learning and the relationship of all interested parties, in other words, teachers, students, and educational institutions.;"[Akhmetzadina, Zulfiya R.] Bashkir State Univ, Sibai Inst Branch, Sibai, Russia; [Mukhtarullina, Aigul R.] Bashkir State Univ, Ufa, Russia; [Starodubtseva, Elena A.; Kozlova, Maria N.] Financial Univ Govt Russian Federat, Moscow, Russia; [Pluzhnikova, Yulia A.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Kolomna Inst Branch, Kolomna, Russia";"Ufa University of Science & Technology; Ufa University of Science & Technology; Financial University Under the Government of Russian Federation; Moscow Polytechnic University";Akhmetzadina, ZR (автор для корреспонденции), Bashkir State Univ, Sibai Inst Branch, Sibai, Russia.;zrakh@rambler.ru;;Kozlova, Maria/0000-0002-3675-3704;;;;;24;0;0;1;1;FRONTIERS MEDIA SA;LAUSANNE;AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND;;2504-284X;;FRONT EDUC;Front.

The wastes of non-ferrous metallurgy sub-branches form exploitable resources, which, in addition to economic damage from incomplete metal extraction, cause environmental problems. The primary technologies for processing complex ores, which fail to provide waste-free concentration, cause an imbalance between raw material extraction and processing indicators since all the applied methods do not provide waste-free concentration processes. It is possible to increase the extraction of metals up to the background level by treating them with chemical reagent solutions at the time of formation of active mineral surfaces. There is also a tendency to involve metal leaching technologies in the exploitation of waste storages. The possibility of improving recovery rates during ore concentration provides a combination of traditional technologies with new technologies by supplementing the traditional technological chain with activator devices. The combination of traditional and new low-waste technologies will strengthen mineral safety through the rational use of the existing mineral resource base.;"[Golik, V. I.; Klyuev, R.

The aim of the study is to improve the processes of blade processing of small-sized parts made of beryllium bronze and the 29 NK alloy to provide rational conditions for thermal pulse deburring. Surface samples were experimentally obtained after turning in different modes on a CITIZEN CINCOM K16E-VII automatic lathe equipped with an Applitec micromechanics tool. The surface quality and burr characteristics were examined using a JEOL JIB-Z4500 electron microscope and a ContourGT-K optical profilometer.

Through DR programs, users are encouraged for utilizing renewable energy and reducing their power consumption at peak times, thereby helping to balance supply and demand on the grid, as well as generating revenue from the sale of excess power. This paper presents an effective energy management layout (EML) for household DR employing Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Fuzzy Reasoning (FR). RL would be a model-free control method that consists of doing measures and assessing the outcomes as it interacts with the environments. Through direct integration of customer feedback into its control logic, the suggested method takes into account user satisfaction by utilizing FR as a reward function. Through the shift of controllable devices from peak hours, whenever energy cost is higher, to off-peak periods, whenever energy cost is low, Q-learning, an RL method according to a reward scheme, has been applied for scheduling the execution of smart home devices. With the suggested method, 14 home devices can be controlled by one agent, and many status-action pairs as well as fuzzy logic for the reward function are used to assess the actions taken for a particular status. Simulations are implemented in the digital twin envi-ronment and demonstrate that the suggested device planning method smooths the energy usage and minimizes the energy price by taking into account the consumers' satisfaction, the consumers' feedback, and their satis-faction settings. The Home EML has been presented with a consumer interface in MATLAB/Simulink for demonstrating the suggested DR approach. The simulation tools include smart devices, energy price signals, smart meters, solar photovoltaics, batteries, electric vehicle, and grid supply.;"[Liu, Huafeng; Liu, Qine] State Grid Hubei Xiangyang Power Supply Co, Xiangyang 441000, Peoples R China; [Rao, Chaoping] Wuhan Qingchuan Univ, Coll Mech & Elect Engn, Wuhan 430204, Peoples R China; [Wang, Fei] State Grid Hubei Jingmen Power Supply Co, Jingmen 448000, Peoples R China; [Alsokhiry, Fahad] King Abdulaziz Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia; [V.

These changes need to focus on the development of domestic tourism in Russia. In one hand, this brings about the need for a large number of specialists in domestic tourism and, on the other hand, for systemic adjustments to the training of future specialists in the organization of tourism. Thus, the study aims to identify factors in the formation of professional competence in future specialists in the organization of regional tourism in higher education. These factors are established through analysis of scientific sources and the results of an expert survey. We have identified to two groups of the major factors that need to be taken into consideration when training specialists. The first group of factors affects the content of training and, in particular, includes targeted formation of student motivation to master professional skills and abilities in developing regional tourist products using national experience. The second group influences the methods of training (e.g. including the use of group training methods and interactive technologies). conclusions show that he effectiveness of the formation of the professional competence of future specialists in the organization of regional tourism will be ensured primarily by targeted formation of students' motivation to master professional skills and abilities to form a regional tourist product and the use of national experience of formation and implementation of regional tourist products in the activities of tourist enterprises.

Nevertheless, the fact that there are a large number of working conditions, and the ongoing development of science and technology, require continuous improvement and specification of the models intended for crushing processes and those of the devices concerned. However, there are few studies related to single-roll gyratory crushers. Such crushers are promising for use in mines to crush rocks laid in the developed space. Mathematical modeling and optimization of the design parameters of the working chamber and the executive body (roll) of a single-roll gyratory shaft crusher, designed for crushing strong rocks, was performed in this paper. A differential equation was derived. As a result of its solution, the rational shape of the working chamber cheek of the single-roll gyratory crusher was established, representing a logarithmic spiral arc. Analytical expressions were derived to determine the rational rotation speed and productivity of the crusher under consideration. Expressions for calculating the kinematic load components acting on the roll were formulated. They are the periodic functions of the shaft rotation angle. The Fourier series expansion showed that the loads contained harmonics of the first, second, third and fourth orders. Using the concept of fuzzy sets, a multi-criteria optimization of the design parameters of the working chamber was performed, including the values of the eccentricity and the central angle of the beginning of the cheek profile. The variation coefficients of the kinematic components of the loads acting on the working body reduced, due to the optimal choice of the working chamber profile and the angular coordinates of the installation of the fixed cheeks. The torque reduced 1.67 times, while the radial load decreased 1.2 times.;"[Kondrakhin, Vitalii P.] Russian Acad Sci, Sci Dept, Kh Ibragimov Complex Inst, Staropromyslovskoe Ave 21 A, Grozny 364906, Russia; [Martyushev, Nikita V.] Tomsk Polytech Univ, Dept Mat Sci, 30 Lenin Ave, Tomsk 634050, Russia; [Klyuev, Roman V.; Qi, Mengxu] Moscow Polytech Univ, Tech & Technol Min & Oil & Gas Prod Dept, 33 B Semenovskaya Str, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Sorokova, Svetlana N.; Efremenkov, Egor A.] Tomsk Polytech Univ, Dept Mech Engn, 30 Lenin Ave, Tomsk 634050, Russia; [Valuev, Denis V.] Tomsk Polytech Univ, Yurga Technol Inst Branch, 26 Leningradskaya St, Yurga 652055, Russia";"Ibragimov Complex Research Institute; Russian Academy of Sciences; Tomsk Polytechnic University; Moscow Polytechnic University; Tomsk Polytechnic University; Tomsk Polytechnic University";Martyushev, NV (автор для корреспонденции), Tomsk Polytech Univ, Dept Mat Sci, 30 Lenin Ave, Tomsk 634050, Russia.;"vkondrakhin52@mail.ru; martjushev@tpu.ru; kluev-roman@rambler.ru";"Valuev, Denis Viktorovich/JKJ-3890-2023; Klyuev, Roman/J-8000-2014; Mengxu, Qi/JKI-9975-2023; Efremenkov, Egor Alekseevich/F-1420-2014; Klyuev, Roman Vladimirovich/AAX-6549-2021; Martyushev, Nikita/AAO-2653-2020";"Valuev, Denis Viktorovich/0000-0001-5131-8754; Klyuev, Roman/0000-0003-3777-7203; Efremenkov, Egor Alekseevich/0000-0001-6617-9152; Klyuev, Roman Vladimirovich/0000-0003-3777-7203; Martyushev, Nikita/0000-0003-0620-9561";;;;;30;6;6;11;12;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;2227-7390;;MATHEMATICS-BASEL;Mathematics;MAY 17;2023;11;10;;;;;;;2345;10.3390/math11102345;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/math11102345;;;16;Mathematics;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Mathematics;H8AX1;;gold;;;2023-12-25;WOS:000998135900001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Schoolchildren in the control group were engaged in a standard physical education program at school, and children from the experimental group additionally performed burpee exercises. Endurance indicators were determined by the test running a distance of 2 kilometers (Running 2 km). The Bourdon test determined indicators of concentration of attention in children. The study used the T-criterion tests. During the study period, the level of endurance development improved by only 1.9% (p>0.05), and the concentration indicators improved from 72.2 +/- 5.8 to 75.5 +/- 6.1 (p>0.05). A slight increase in the indicators in both tests in the control group can be explained by the natural increase in the indicators of schoolchildren over four months and the effectiveness of using the standard physical education program at school. In the experimental group (9th grade), the indicators in both tests significantly (significantly) improved. Endurance of schoolchildren increased by 9% (p<0.05), and concentration indicators improved from 73.2 +/- 4.9 to 86.6 +/- 6.2 (p<0.05).

E-noses generate unique signature patterns for various volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and, by leveraging artificial intelligence, detect the presence of various VOCs, gases, and smokes onsite. Widespread monitoring of airborne hazards across many remote locations is possible by creating a network of gas sensors using Internet connectivity, which consumes significant power. Long-range (LoRa)-based wireless networks do not require Internet connectivity while operating independently. Therefore, we propose a networked intelligent gas sensor system (N-IGSS) which uses a LoRa low-power wide-area networking protocol for real-time airborne pollution hazard detection and monitoring. We developed a gas sensor node by using an array of seven cross-selective tin-oxide-based metal-oxide semiconductor (MOX) gas sensor elements interfaced with a low-power microcontroller and a LoRa module. Experimentally, we exposed the sensor node to six classes i.e., five VOCs plus ambient air and as released by burning samples of tobacco, paints, carpets, alcohol, and incense sticks. Using the proposed two-stage analysis space transformation approach, the captured dataset was first preprocessed using the standardized linear discriminant analysis (SLDA) method. Four different classifiers, namely AdaBoost, XGBoost, Random Forest (RF), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), were then trained and tested in the SLDA transformation space.

The developed method for screen printing provides the formation of polycrystalline films of a specified area per cycle, provided that there is a possibility for varying their thickness from tens of microns to units, which allows reducing the solar cell's thickness and facilitating the process of its connection with the substrate. Therefore, the application of the films to a sitall substrate by screen printing contributes to reducing the product weight and facilitating the process of joining sheet materials intended for solar panels, namely attaching the lasing element to the substrate. The purpose of this work is to study the morphological peculiarities of polycrystalline CdS1-xSex films obtained by an optimized screen-printing method and to create a model of their formation process. The structural and morphological peculiarities of the samples were studied using electron microscopy, AFM, XPA, and XFS. As a result of the work, based on the obtained experimental data, a model of the film formation process was developed. The model validity is justified by the conformity of the data of the experiment performed on its basis.;"[Strateichuk, Diana M.] State Technol Univ, North Caucasian Inst Min & Met, Dept Informat Technol & Syst, 44 Nikolaev Str, Vladikavkaz 362011, Russia; [Martyushev, Nikita V.] Tomsk Polytech Univ, Dept Adv Technol, 30 Lenin Ave, Tomsk 634050, Russia; [Klyuev, Roman V.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Tech & Technol Min & Oil & Gas Prod Dept, 33, B Semenovskaya Str, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Gladkikh, Vitaliy A.; Karlina, Antonina I.] Moscow State Univ Civil Engn, Stroytest Res & Testing Ctr, 26, Yaroslavskoye Shosse, Moscow 129337, Russia; [Kukartsev, Vladislav V.] Siberian Fed Univ, Inst Space & Informat Technol, Dept Informat, Krasnoyarsk 660041, Russia; [Kukartsev, Vladislav V.] Reshetnev Siberian State Univ Sci & Technol, Inst Engn & Econ, Dept Informat Econ Syst, Krasnoyarsk 660037, Russia; [Kukartsev, Vladislav V.] Bauman Moscow State Tech Univ, Digital Mat Sci New Mat & Technol, Moscow 105005, Russia; [Tynchenko, Yadviga A.] Siberian Fed Univ, Lab Biofuel Composit, Krasnoyarsk 660041, Russia; [Tynchenko, Yadviga A.] Reshetnev Siberian State Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Syst Anal & Operat Res, Krasnoyarsk 660037, Russia";"North Caucasian Institute of Mining & Metallurgy (State Technological University); Tomsk Polytechnic University; Moscow Polytechnic University; Moscow State University of Civil Engineering; Siberian Federal University; Reshetnev Siberian State University of Science & Technology; Bauman Moscow State Technical University; Siberian Federal University; Reshetnev Siberian State University of Science & Technology";Martyushev, NV (автор для корреспонденции), Tomsk Polytech Univ, Dept Adv Technol, 30 Lenin Ave, Tomsk 634050, Russia.;"diana.a83@mail.ru; martjushev@tpu.ru; kluev-roman@rambler.ru; gladkich_87@mail.ru; vlad_saa_2000@mail.ru; t080801@yandex.ru; karlinat@mail.ru";"Klyuev, Roman/J-8000-2014; Kukartsev, Vladislav/U-6956-2019; Gladkikh, Vitaliy/F-1577-2017; Klyuev, Roman Vladimirovich/AAX-6549-2021; Martyushev, Nikita/AAO-2653-2020; Karlina, Antonina/H-8191-2016";"Klyuev, Roman/0000-0003-3777-7203; Kukartsev, Vladislav/0000-0001-6382-1736; Gladkikh, Vitaliy/0000-0003-1953-1584; Klyuev, Roman Vladimirovich/0000-0003-3777-7203; Martyushev, Nikita/0000-0003-0620-9561; Karlina, Antonina/0000-0003-3287-3298";;;;;30;1;1;2;2;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;2073-4352;;CRYSTALS;Crystals;MAY 16;2023;13;5;;;;;;;825;10.3390/cryst13050825;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/cryst13050825;;;19;"Crystallography; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Crystallography; Materials Science";H6OG2;;gold;;;2023-12-25;WOS:000997127600001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Aanelasticity caused by structural transitions were studied using temperature-, time-, and amplitude-dependent tests. The sample subjected to compression combined with torsion demonstrates a much higher thermodynamical stimulus for recrystallization and higher dislocation density, consequently it exhibits a more rapid decrease in dislocation density both at instant heating and isothermal annealing.

Such an analysis is necessary to identify the potential for energy savings and reduce energy costs per product cost. In the presented work, on the basis of data on the power consumption of a large processing plant, an analysis of the energy characteristics of autogenous grinding mills was carried out. Based on the data on the power consumption of the processing plant departments, statistical estimates were obtained: average (estimation of the mathematical expectation); standard (unbiased estimate of standard deviation). The technological process of grinding separation is given, the regime map of the technological process of the self-grinding body is shown. The utilization factors for active power, the forms of the load schedule, the filling of the load schedule are determined. The dynamics of change in the power value during the hours of the evening maximum of the power system over the decades of the month under study is given. An empirical method for calculating the power of the drive motor of the MMC-70x23 mill is given. The dependence of the power consumption of the MMC engine on the degree of loading and bulk weight of ore is obtained. Comparison of the calculated power of the drive motor with the installed power of the synchronous motor type SDM-16-49-6, equal to 1600 kW, with a gearbox type TSh 125 D indicates that the drive meets the requirements.

The perspective of a decrease in the content of lanthanum from 2 to 0.5 wt % in new alloys has been validated using advanced methods for analyzing the structure and phase composition (electron microscopy, X-ray phase analysis, thermodynamic calculation) and using the analysis of mechanical (tensile) properties formed in the course of deformation treatment. The evolution of the structure of the alloys was studied in the course of thermodeformation treatment. It has been shown that upon hot rolling at 400 degrees C with no preliminary annealing of ingots it is possible to obtain high-quality deformed semiproducts (sheets) with no surface and edge defects (up to a 90% reduction). The deformation treatment provides the formation of a structure with inclusions of a (Al,Mn)(4)(Ca,La) eutectic phase uniformly distributed in an aluminum matrix and found in a form of ring-shaped precipitates of submicron sizes (300 x 150 nm). In addition, the formation of a net of low-angle boundaries (subgrains) with a mean size of similar to 1 mu m is observed; some inclusions of a eutectic phase are found along these boundaries. This combination of structural characteristics mainly determines the ability of reaching favorable mechanical properties of an alloy after hot rolling with 0.5 wt % La (the ultimate strength of 240-260 MPa, yield strength of 185-205 MPa, and relative elongation of 5.5-9.0%), which are comparable with the properties of the previously studied alloy with up to 2 wt % La.";"[Letyagin, N.

In addition, a believing brother can never be filled when his fellow believer is hungry, and he cannot be clothed while the other is with nothing on. Islam further considers all Muslims as one family and calls everyone brothers and sisters or siblings. The true Muslims of any race and tribe as well as any language and age thus have a deep sense of brotherhood with each other, even if one lives in the Eastern parts of the world and the other in the West.

Improvement of the start-up system of the main diesel locomotive when using a supercapacitor allows multiple restarts of diesel locomotives, meaning that the operation of the diesel locomotive can be stopped several times without wasting fuel in idle operations. In this study, we simulated the electric starting circuit of a diesel locomotive with a block of supercapacitors using the Matlab Simulink program. The simulation results show that using only a supercapacitor in the start-up system is impossible. Even though the supercapacitor produces the required current and voltage, its operating time is extremely insufficient. Using a storage battery along with a supercapacitor in the diesel locomotive start-up system is most effective. This reduces the peak current load on the standard battery. The article suggests an effective principle for starting a mainline diesel locomotive and provides an effective circuit solution involving a supercapacitor. Based on the booster stabilizer scheme, a new scheme was modeled to study the successful launch of a diesel locomotive that has various start-up systems. Applying a supercapacitor in the start-up system of a main diesel locomotive is proposed and the results of its use are presented. In addition, this study defines the basic requirements for using a system based on a battery in conjunction with a supercapacitor. Characteristics such as the temperature range of the system are shown.;"[Malozyomov, Boris V.] Novosibirsk State Tech Univ, Dept Electrotech Complexes, 20,Karl Marks Ave, Novosibirsk 630073, Russia; [Martyushev, Nikita V.] Tomsk Polytech Univ, Dept Adv Technol, Tomsk 634050, Russia; [Kukartsev, Viktor Alekseevich] Siberian Fed Univ, Polytech Inst, Dept Mat Sci & Mat Proc Technol, Krasnoyarsk 660041, Russia; [Kukartsev, Vladislav Viktorovich] Siberian Fed Univ, Inst Space & Informat Technol, Dept Informat, Krasnoyarsk 660041, Russia; [Kukartsev, Vladislav Viktorovich] Reshetnev Siberian State Univ Sci & Technol, Inst Engn & Econ, Dept Informat Econ Syst, Krasnoyarsk 660037, Russia; [Kukartsev, Vladislav Viktorovich] Bauman Moscow State Tech Univ, Digital Mat Sci New Mat & Technol, Moscow 105005, Russia; [Tynchenko, Sergei Vasilievich] Siberian Fed Univ, Inst Business Proc Management, Dept Digital Control Technol, Krasnoyarsk 660041, Russia; [Tynchenko, Sergei Vasilievich] Reshetnev Siberian State Univ Sci & Technol, Inst Comp Sci & Telecommun, Dept Comp Sci & Comp Engn, Krasnoyarsk 660037, Russia; [Klyuev, Roman V.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Tech & Technol Min & Oil & Gas Prod Dept, 33, B Semenovskaya Str, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Zagorodnii, Nikolay A.] Belgorod State Technol Univ, Dept Operat, Kostukov St, Belgorod 308012, Russia; [Zagorodnii, Nikolay A.] Belgorod State Technol Univ, Org Vehicle Traff, Kostukov St, Belgorod 308012, Russia; Siberian Fed Univ, Lab Biofuel Composit, Krasnoyarsk 660041, Russia; Reshetnev Siberian State Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Syst Anal & Operat Res, Krasnoyarsk 660037, Russia";"Novosibirsk State Technical University; Tomsk Polytechnic University; Siberian Federal University; Siberian Federal University; Reshetnev Siberian State University of Science & Technology; Bauman Moscow State Technical University; Siberian Federal University; Reshetnev Siberian State University of Science & Technology; Moscow Polytechnic University; Belgorod State Technological University; Belgorod State Technological University; Siberian Federal University; Reshetnev Siberian State University of Science & Technology";Klyuev, RV (автор для корреспонденции), Moscow Polytech Univ, Tech & Technol Min & Oil & Gas Prod Dept, 33, B Semenovskaya Str, Moscow 107023, Russia.;"borisnovel@mail.ru; kluev-roman@rambler.ru";"Klyuev, Roman/J-8000-2014; Klyuev, Roman Vladimirovich/AAX-6549-2021; Kukartsev, Vladislav/U-6956-2019; Malozyomov, Boris V./J-1723-2016; Tynchenko, Vadim/N-5468-2016; Martyushev, Nikita/AAO-2653-2020";"Klyuev, Roman/0000-0003-3777-7203; Klyuev, Roman Vladimirovich/0000-0003-3777-7203; Kukartsev, Vladislav/0000-0001-6382-1736; Malozyomov, Boris V./0000-0001-8686-9556; Tynchenko, Vadim/0000-0002-3959-2969; Martyushev, Nikita/0000-0003-0620-9561";;;;;48;7;7;4;6;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;1996-1073;;ENERGIES;Energies;MAY 5;2023;16;9;;;;;;;3909;10.3390/en16093909;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en16093909;;;24;Energy & Fuels;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Energy & Fuels;G2AP8;;gold;;;2023-12-25;WOS:000987252300001;View Full Record in Web of Science

An environmentally friendly technology for the recycling of CPSs by multi-stage methods developed at the National Research Center Kurchatov Institute - IREA is presented. The technology involves opening, crushing, and grinding (with mechanical activation), followed by liquid-solid leaching and liquid-liquid extraction. The target product is a powdery precipitate containing compounds of cobalt (Co), lithium (Li), manganese (Mn), nickel (Ni), etc. The grinding stage (in a ball mill or a disintegrator) leads to the destruction of the particle structure, changing their specific surface area and porosity. As a result, the intensity and efficiency of the extraction processes increase. The textural characteristics (such as specific surface area, porosity, total pore volume, micro- and mesopore volume) of crushed and powdered samples containing graphite with inclusions of Co and Li compounds are determined. The methods implemented in the Micromeritics ASAP 2020 analyzer software such as BET, t-Plot, Dubinin-Radushkevich, Dubinin-Astakhov, Horvath-Kawazoe, and BJH are used. The calculated texture characteristics can be used to optimize the extraction of the target components from a mechanically activated powder during leaching followed by extraction.;"[Nazarov, V.

There is a downward trend in the ore mining rate, which confirms the expediency of processing substandard ores and disposing accumulated waste. A strategy for restoring the lost potential including the use of metal-leaching technologies is formulated. The advantages of such technologies are characterized. It is pointed out that most of the ore processing waste can be used in production. The results of experiments on brining non-extracted metals into solution are presented. The advantages of leaching in disintegrator mills are shown by comparison with the reference case. Changing the quality of recycled mill tailings makes it possible to implement the principles of resource saving for gaining economic benefits. It is concluded that the recommended technology shows a way of technological diversification of production, tailings can be a cheap and affordable raw material for related industries, and the mechanochemical activation of the leaching process in a disintegrator ensures the recovery of metals from the mill tailings of Sadon polymetallic ores. Quantitative strength characteristics of the hardening mixture as a result of activation by alternative methods are obtained.

The aim of the work is to determine the influence of the structure of the filter materials formed as a result of modification of the surface layer on their water permeability and the size of trapped solid particles. Materials and methods. The non-woven fabrics from a mixture of polyethylene-terephthalate (PET) (70 wt.%) and bicomponent fibers (BCF) of the core-shell structure were used as objects of the study. The non-woven fabrics were obtained by mechanically forming the canvas with its subsequent hardening by needle punching. The resulting materials were modified by heat treatment. The water transfer in the modified materials was determined by the permeability coefficient. The filtration efficiency was determined by the number of trapped particles of a certain size. Results and discussion. The needle-punched non-woven fabrics without additional heat treatment are not suitable for water filtration. The proposed method of thermal and deformation-thermal modification provides the production of gradient materials with a controlled thickness of the nanoscale surface layer. Although a decrease in water permeability is observed, the modified material traps solid particles with a smaller (compared to unmodified similar to 20 mu m) equivalent diameter of 2-4 mu m, which is sufficient to prepare water for use in steam generators and in the production of building materials. Conclusion. The optimal parameters of deformation-heat treatment for obtaining the high-effective filtration non-woven materials were established: the temperature - 180 degrees C, the processing speed - 3.5 m/min.;"[Nazarov, Victor G.; Dedov, Alexander V.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Moscow, Russia; [Ivanov, Leonid A.] Russian Acad Engn, Moscow, Russia; [Bokova, Elena S.] Russian State Univ, Moscow, Russia; [Statnik, Evgeny S.] Skolkovo Inst Sci & Technol, Moscow, Russia";"Moscow Polytechnic University; Skolkovo Institute of Science & Technology";Dedov, AV (автор для корреспонденции), Moscow Polytech Univ, Moscow, Russia.;dedovs55@rambler.ru;"Dedov, Alexander/JAN-8989-2023; Nazarov, Victor/B-2274-2014";"Nazarov, Victor/0000-0002-7243-9739; Statnik, Eugene/0000-0002-1105-9206; , Aleksandr/0000-0001-9636-9467; Ivanov, Leonid/0000-0001-9513-8712";;;;;22;0;0;3;3;NANOSTROITEL STVO;MOSCOW;GAZETNYI PER-K, DOM 9, STR 4, MOSCOW, 125009, RUSSIA;2075-8545;;;NANOTECHNOL CONSTR;Nanotechnol.

Methods and materials: The article considers the developed mathematical model of vertical oscillations of the monorail track, which allows setting the interconnection between the rolling stock parameters and dynamic loads in the suspension. At vertical oscillations of the monorail and under the effect of harmonic disturbing force caused by the movement of the suspension, the system of the monorail suspension can be represented in the form of a dual-mass system. Results: As a result, the equations for oscillation amplitudes of the monorail elements were obtained and damping coefficient of suspension was defined. The obtained results suggest setting reasonable parameters of the monorail fastening, which offers the possibility to decrease dynamic loads occurring during the operation of the mine suspended monorail tracks. The proposed monorail suspension makes it possible to reduce the dynamic loads formed during the movement of the rolling stock by 30-40% and can be used to modernize existing mine suspended monorails. Discussion: Analysis of the obtained results shows that in order to reduce the vibration amplitudes of a suspended monorail mine, it is appropriate to use suspension systems for rolling stock and a monorail track, consisting of elastic elements. The parameters required for this can be determined using the proposed method, and required rigidity of the monorail track is provided by embedding elastic supports into its suspension system. Conclusions: The obtained results allow setting reasonable parameters of the monorail fastening of the mine suspended monorail tracks. The proposed monorail suspension makes it possible to minimize the dynamic loads formed during the movement of rolling stock and can be used to modernize existing mine suspension monorails.;"[Gutarevich, Viktor O.] Russian Acad Sci, Sci Dept, Kh Ibragimov Complex Inst, Staropromyslovskoe Ave 21, Grozny 364906, Russia; [Martyushev, Nikita V.] Tomsk Polytech Univ, Dept Adv Technol, 30 Lenin Ave, Tomsk 634050, Russia; [Klyuev, Roman V.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Tech & Technol Min & Oil & Gas Prod Dept, 33 B Semenovskaya Str, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Kukartsev, Viktor A.] Siberian Fed Univ, Polytech Inst, Dept Mat Sci & Mat Proc Technol, Krasnoyarsk 660041, Russia; [Kukartsev, Vladislav V.] Siberian Fed Univ, Inst Space & Informat Technol, Dept Informat, Krasnoyarsk 660041, Russia; [Kukartsev, Vladislav V.] Reshetnev Siberian State Univ Sci & Technol, Inst Engn & Econ, Dept Informat Econ Syst, Krasnoyarsk 660037, Russia; [Kukartsev, Vladislav V.] Bauman Moscow State Tech Univ, Digital Mat Sci New Mat & Technol, Moscow 105005, Russia; [Iushkova, Liudmila V.] Siberian Fed Univ, Dept Business & Mkt, Krasnoyarsk 660041, Russia; [Iushkova, Liudmila V.] Minist Emergency Situat Russia, Dept State & Municipal Adm, Siberian Fire & Rescue Acad State Fire Serv, Zheleznogorsk 662972, Russia; [Korpacheva, Larisa N.] Siberian Fed Univ, Inst Business Proc Management, Dept Digital Management Technol, Krasnoyarsk 660041, Russia";"Ibragimov Complex Research Institute; Russian Academy of Sciences; Tomsk Polytechnic University; Moscow Polytechnic University; Siberian Federal University; Siberian Federal University; Reshetnev Siberian State University of Science & Technology; Bauman Moscow State Technical University; Siberian Federal University; Siberian Federal University";Martyushev, NV (автор для корреспонденции), Tomsk Polytech Univ, Dept Adv Technol, 30 Lenin Ave, Tomsk 634050, Russia.;"viktor.gutarevich@mail.ru; martjushev@tpu.ru";"Klyuev, Roman Vladimirovich/AAX-6549-2021; Klyuev, Roman/J-8000-2014; Tynchenko, Vadim/N-5468-2016; Kukartsev, Vladislav/U-6956-2019; Gutarevych, Viktor/A-2783-2016; Martyushev, Nikita/AAO-2653-2020";"Klyuev, Roman Vladimirovich/0000-0003-3777-7203; Klyuev, Roman/0000-0003-3777-7203; Tynchenko, Vadim/0000-0002-3959-2969; Kukartsev, Vladislav/0000-0001-6382-1736; Gutarevych, Viktor/0000-0002-6294-5232; Martyushev, Nikita/0000-0003-0620-9561";;;;;24;5;5;7;10;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;2076-3417;;APPL SCI-BASEL;Appl.

The use of concrete historical, comparative legal, structural and systemic methods in the study allowed us to draw conclusions relevant for filling historical and legal gaps in Russian-Turkmen relations. Despite the tolerant attitude of the imperial authorities and even the support of some Muslim-legal (religious-ceremonial, family-household and moral) prescriptions, Sharia could not subdue all aspects of Turkmen life and replace customary law (adat), which played a major role in all periods of development of Turkmen society. Sharia were clarified and applied. During the imperial period, thanks to the activities of the Russian administration and the central government, the jurisdiction of Muslim law expanded significantly; it received a judicial tribune in the form of such a centralized body as the Extraordinary Congress of People's Judges, with the help of which some guiding principles of both Adat and Sharia were clarified and applied. The rapidly changing socio-economic situation caused by the close interaction of traditional Turkmen institutions with Russian state bodies (changes in the economic and lifestyle of the local population, binding to market relations, non-belittling of the role of Islam and Adat in its spiritual life, their compromise combination with the general laws of the empire, the practice of improved forms of popular justice) led to a change in the traditional legal consciousness of the Turkmen. The desire of the imperial center and the Russian administration of Transcaspia for the regulatory and legal regulation of life in the family, marriage and other spheres allowed this people to gradually integrate into the all-imperial state and legal space, while preserving stability, family and religious values.";[Ilya, Aminov] Moscow Polytech Univ, Moscow, Russia;Moscow Polytechnic University;Ilya, A (автор для корреспонденции), Moscow Polytech Univ, Moscow, Russia.;;;;;;;;10;0;0;0;0;STATE ACAD UNIV HUMANITIES;MOSCOW;LENINSKII PR-KT 32A, MOSCOW, 119334, RUSSIA;2079-8784;;;ISTORIYA-ELEKTRON;Istoriya;;2022;13;10;;;;;;;;10.18254/S207987840023193-1;http://dx.doi.org/10.18254/S207987840023193-1;;;10;History;Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI);History;E5YY8;;;;;2023-12-25;WOS:000976308800005;View Full Record in Web of Science

The results of the study made it possible to determine the yield strength (deformation resistance), ultimate strength and relative elongation of strips of the BrOF6.5-0.15 bronze alloy after rolling with a percent reduction epsilon = 6-27%. The strips 3 mm thick, 30 mm wide, and approximately 200 mm long were used for test rolling. Based on the data obtained, hardening curves were constructed, which made it possible to establish quantitative patterns of changes in the metal deformation resistance (yield strength) sigma(T), ultimate strength sigma(B) and relative elongation delta on the deformation degree of the BrOF6.5-0.15 bronze alloy of a specific chemical composition.Regression equations for calculating and predicting changes in the main indicators of the mechanical properties of strips of the BrOF6.5-0.15 alloy during cold rolling with various reductions have been obtained. The adequacy of the equations obtained, confirmed by high correlation coefficients (R-2 > 0.9), allows recommending them for calculating the force indicators of rolling and the use in computer-aided design systems (CAD) of rational deformation modes of strips of BrOF6.5-0.15 bronze.;"[Shatalov, R.

A unifying parallel is drawn between resource-dependent countries and regions with depleted mineral resources. The objective factors of losses of accessed reserves are analyzed. A unifying parallel is drawn between sub-standard ores and industrial waste. The paper proposes shifting geotechnology development from simple mineral extraction towards technologies that provide a full cycle of geo-resources development. A radical way of ensuring a full cycle of geo-resources development is the involvement of sub-standard ores and industrial waste in a closed processing cycle. The utilization of industrial waste without a valuable component extracting or reducing a harmful component to a background value is palliative. A comparative description of various technologies that allow extracting valuable components from sub-standard ores and industrial waste is made. The paper proposes a variant of chemical-physical technology that makes it possible to extract a valuable component from industrial waste to a minimum value. The activation of industrial waste with a disintegrator before a chemical extraction significantly increases the yield of a valuable component from 2.6 to 218.5%. A differentiated approach is needed regarding the choice of leaching solution, its percentage, as well as the leaching method and the need for activation processing of valuable components and industrial ones. The combined highly efficient physical-chemical and physical-technical technologies will ensure the maximum extraction of the valuable component from 52.6 to 98.8% in the full cycle of natural and industrial geo-resources development.;"[Kongar-Syuryun, Cheynesh B.] St Petersburg Min Univ, Min Dept, 21st Line 2, St Petersburg 199106, Russia; [Aleksakhin, Alexander V.; Eliseeva, Evgeniya N.] Natl Univ Sci & Technol MISiS, Econ Dept, Leninsky Ave 4, Moscow 119991, Russia; [Zhaglovskaya, Anna V.] Natl Univ Sci & Technol MISiS, Coll Econ & Ind Management, Dept Ind Management, Leninsky Ave 4, Moscow 119991, Russia; [Klyuev, Roman V.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Tech & Technol Min & Oil & Gas Prod, 38 B Semenovskaya St, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Petrusevich, Denis A.] MIREA Russian Technol Univ RTU MIREA, Inst Artificial Intelligence, Higher Math Chair, Vernadsky Ave 78, Moscow 119454, Russia";"Saint Petersburg Mining University; National University of Science & Technology (MISIS); National University of Science & Technology (MISIS); Moscow Polytechnic University; MIREA - Russian Technological University";Kongar-Syuryun, CB (автор для корреспонденции), St Petersburg Min Univ, Min Dept, 21st Line 2, St Petersburg 199106, Russia.;kongarsiuriun@gmail.com;"Klyuev, Roman Vladimirovich/AAX-6549-2021; Klyuev, Roman/J-8000-2014";"Klyuev, Roman Vladimirovich/0000-0003-3777-7203; Klyuev, Roman/0000-0003-3777-7203";;;;;54;5;5;1;3;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;2079-9276;;RESOURCES-BASEL;Resources-Basel;APR;2023;12;4;;;;;;;50;10.3390/resources12040050;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/resources12040050;;;14;Green & Sustainable Science & Technology;Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI);Science & Technology - Other Topics;E7XP3;;gold;;;2023-12-25;WOS:000977631000001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Consequently, high-performance metal hybrid composites have been developed. However, achieving the optimal mix for the reinforcement combination with regards to the optimal performance of developed composite remains a challenge.

A mixture design was involved in the experimental design, and experimental data were modeled and optimized to achieve the optimal performance of the trihybrid composite. The ANOVA, response surface plots, and ternary maps analyses of the experimental results revealed that various combinations of reinforcement particles displayed a variety of response trends.

I.E.Zabelin is known not only for his purely historical works, but also works in the field of archeology. Under his leadership, the richest Scythian burial mounds in southern Russia were excavated. The most famous of them is the Chertomlyk mound, which broughtreal masterpieces of Scythian and Greek art to the treasury of the Imperial Hermitage. Scientists who analyzed the activities of I.E. Zabelin as an archaeologist, were based, as a rule, on publications belonging to the pen of the scientist. This gave riseto a series of misunderstandings and false accusations against the great Russian historian. The authors of this article used archival materials, manuscripts and field diaries of I.E. Zabelin, which allowed to debunk a number of biases that have become a kind of scientific myths. I.E. Zabelin appears as an attentive, thorough and observant archaeologist who developed his own, innovative methods of excavation and fixation of layers, as evidenced by the plans and sections of the mounds made by him. The historian independently analyzed the materials of the expeditions, studied the works of ancient authors, carried out thorough measurements and compiled detailed descriptions of monuments and artifacts.

The pedagogical experiment was conducted for 4 months based on the secondary general educational school 60 (Kirov, Russia), 120 schoolchildren from the third grade took part in it. 34 physical education lessons were held in each class. Schoolchildren from the control group were engaged in a standard physical education program for younger schoolchildren. The children from the experimental group also worked within the framework of the usual program, but during each lesson, they performed a long run of 6 minutes. Overall endurance was assessed using the K Cooper (6 minutes) test and the attention of schoolchildren was assessed by the Schulte Tables test. Both tests were performed before and after the pedagogical experiment. Prior to the study, there were no significant differences between classes in both tests (p>0.05). After the end of the study, the performance of children in the control group improved in the endurance test by 6.8% and 7.2% (p>0.05), and in the experimental group improved by 24.9% and 18.9% (p<0.05). In the attention test, the indicators of the control group increased by 10.1% and 8.6% (p>0.05), and in the experimental group by 25.2% and 31.2% (p<0.05).

Homologues with methoxy and alkyloxy substituents (series 1) are non-mesogenic, in contrast to homologues with two alkyloxy substituents (series 2) exhibiting columnar mesophase. The results obtained by quantum-chemical calculations for the monomers and dimers of non-mesogenic TTT series and their comparison with truxenone derivatives having identical substituents made it possible to establish the reasons that deprive series 1 of mesogenity. Compounds of both TTT series possess good solubility in organic solvents and capable of specific interactions with solvents in the ground and excited states. They form fluorescenting floating layers and thin films.

We have proposed an algorithm and developed a system for obtaining a map of irrigation for maize in low latency mode. The system can be installed on a center pivot irrigation and consists of 8 IP cameras connected to a DVR connected to a laptop. The algorithm consists of three stages. Image preprocessing stage - applying an integrated excess green and excess red difference (ExGR) index. The classification stage is the application of the method that we choose depending on the system's operating conditions. At the final stage, a neural network trained using the Resilient Propagation method is used, which determines the rate of watering of plants in the current sector of the location of the sprinkler. The selected methods of pretreatment and classification made it possible to achieve an accuracy of plant identification up to 93%, growth stages - up to 92% (with unconsolidated maize sowing and good lighting). System performance up to 100 plants in one second, which exceeds the performance of similar systems. The neural network showed an accuracy of 92% on the training set and 87% on the test set. Dynamic analysis of spatial and temporal variability leads to an increase in productivity and efficiency of water use.

Unfortunately, these properties are lost in thin films due to aggregation quenching effect (ACQ) and internal filter effect, limiting BODIPY application in optical devices. The introduction of bulky substituents into dye molecule should affect the supramolecular organization of BODIPY in thin films. Therefore, using the example of 0-benzyl-substituted complex (1) and bis(BODIPY) dimer (2), we study the influence of bulky substituents at the 0, 0'-positions of these BODIPY molecules on their aggregation behavior in mono-and multilayer Langmuir -Schaefer (LS) films. A comparative analysis of BODIPY spectral properties in LS and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) films has been carried out. It was shown that the presence of bulky benzyl-substituents in 0-positions of pyrrole rings promotes the formation of H-and J-type aggregates in multilayer LS-films of the dye 1 and BODIPY dimer 2. The dye 1 predominantly forms H-type aggregates, while for the dye 2, the equilibrium is shifted towards the formation of J-type aggregates. The studied BODIPYs with a low content of up to 1 wt. % exhibit intense fluorescence being included in PMMA films. The results obtained give the possibility to use more efficiently thin-film structures based on the studied BODIPY thin films in optoelectronics.;"[Sherudillo, A. S.; Antina, L. A.; Berezin, M.

It was found that EIMGM increases the polar component and the complete free surface energy from 26 to 57 mJ/m(2) for LDPE and from 37 to 67 mJ/m(2) for PET (due to the formation of oxygen-containing groups on the surface of the materials). Although the degree of textural and morphological heterogeneity of the modified LDPE increased more than twice compared to the initial state, it is not still suitable for application as a substrate in extrusion 3D printing. However, for PET, the plasma-chemical modification contributed to a significant increase (similar to 5 times) in filament adhesion to its surface (due to chemical and morphological transformations of the surface layers) which allows for using the FFF technology for additive prototyping on the modified PET-substrates.;"[Doronin, Fedor; Rytikov, Georgy; Evdokimov, Andrey; Rudyak, Yury; Taranets, Irina; Nazarov, Victor] Moscow Polytech Univ, Fac Printing Ind, Moscow 107023, Russia";Moscow Polytechnic University;Doronin, F (автор для корреспонденции), Moscow Polytech Univ, Fac Printing Ind, Moscow 107023, Russia.;f.a.doronin@mospolytech.ru;"Nazarov, Victor/B-2274-2014; Evdokimov, Andrey G/AID-9178-2022; Doronin, Fedor Alexandrovich/B-2266-2014; Rytikov, George/J-7097-2014";"Nazarov, Victor/0000-0002-7243-9739; Evdokimov, Andrey G/0000-0002-8124-9187; Doronin, Fedor/0000-0002-0407-060X; Rytikov, George/0000-0001-5521-8662";Ministry of science and higher education of the Russian Federation [FZRR-2023-0003];Ministry of science and higher education of the Russian Federation;This work was carried out with the financial support of the Ministry of science and higher education of the Russian Federation (State assignment FZRR-2023-0003).;;74;1;1;4;5;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;2227-9717;;PROCESSES;Processes;MAR;2023;11;3;;;;;;;774;10.3390/pr11030774;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pr11030774;;;14;Engineering, Chemical;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Engineering;C2IE9;;gold;;;2023-12-25;WOS:000960208100001;View Full Record in Web of Science

The potentials of NOMA are to increase the number of users, the system's capacity, massive connectivity, and enhance the spectrum and energy efficiency in future communication scenarios. However, the practical deployment of NOMA is hindered by the inflexibility caused by the offline design paradigm and non-unified signal processing approaches of different NOMA schemes. The recent innovations and breakthroughs in deep learning (DL) methods have paved the way to adequately address these challenges. The DL-based NOMA can break these fundamental limits of conventional NOMA in several aspects, including throughput, bit-error-rate (BER), low latency, task scheduling, resource allocation, user pairing and other better performance characteristics. This article aims to provide firsthand knowledge of the prominence of NOMA and DL and surveys several DL-enabled NOMA systems. This study emphasizes Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC), Channel State Information (CSI), impulse noise (IN), channel estimation, power allocation, resource allocation, user fairness and transceiver design, and a few other parameters as key performance indicators of NOMA systems. In addition, we outline the integration of DL-based NOMA with several emerging technologies such as intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS), mobile edge computing (MEC), simultaneous wireless and information power transfer (SWIPT), Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM), and multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO). This study also highlights diverse, significant technical hindrances in DL-based NOMA systems. Finally, we identify some future research directions to shed light on paramount developments needed in existing systems as a probable to invigorate further contributions for DL-based NOMA system.;"[Mohsan, Syed Agha Hassnain; Li, Yanlong] Zhejiang Univ, Ocean Coll, Opt Commun Lab, Zheda Rd 1, Zhoushan 316021, Peoples R China; [Li, Yanlong] Guilin Univ Elect Technol, Key Lab Cognit Radio & Informat Proc, Minist Educ, Guilin 541004, Peoples R China; [Shvetsov, Alexey V.

In the last several years, special attention has been paid to the anelastic properties of these alloys. In this review, we collected and analyzed the frequency-, amplitude-, and temperature-dependent anelasticity in Fe-Ga and Fe-Ga-based alloys in the Hertz range of forced and free-decay vibrations. Special attention is paid to anelasticity caused by phase transitions: for this purpose, in situ neutron diffraction tests with the same heating or cooling rates were carried out in parallel with temperature dependencies measurements to control ctructure and phase transitions. The main part of this review is devoted to anelastic effects in binary Fe-Ga alloys, but we also consider ternary alloys of the systems Fe-Ga-Al and Fe-Ga-RE (RE-Rare Earth elements) to discuss similarities and differences between anelastic properties in Fe-Ga and Fe-Al alloys and effect of RE elements. We report and discuss several thermally activated effects, including Zener- and Snoek-type relaxation, several transient anelastic phenomena caused by phase transitions (D0(3) <-> A2, D0(3) -> L1(2), L1(2) <-> D0(19), D0(19) <-> B2, Fe13Ga9 -> L-12+Fe6Ga5 phases), and their influence on the above-mentioned thermally activated effects. We also report amplitude-dependent damping caused by dislocations and magnetic domain walls and try to understand the paradox between the Smith-Birchak model predicting higher damping capacity for materials with higher saturation magnetostriction and existing experimental results. The main attention in this review is paid to alloys with 17-20 and 25-30%Ga as the alloys with the best functional (magnetostriction) properties. Nevertheless, we provide information on a broader range of alloys from 6 to 45%Ga. Due to the limited space, we do not discuss other mechanical and physical properties in depth but focus on anelasticity. A short introduction to the theory of anelasticity precedes the main part of this review of anelastic effects in Fe-Ga and related alloys and unsolved issues are collected in summary.;"[Golovin, Igor S.

The crystals were annealed in air at a temperature of 1000 degrees C for 400 h. The phase analysis of the crystals before and after annealing was studied by X-ray diffractometry and Raman spectroscopy. The study of the ionic conductivity of the crystals was carried out by the method of impedance spectroscopy in the temperature range 400-900 degrees C. It has been shown that when various rare earth cations (Yb, Y, Tb, and Gd) are used, the maximum conductivity is observed for the compositions (ZrO2)(0.91)(Sc2O3)(0.08)(Yb2O3)(0.01), (ZrO2)(0.89)(Sc2O3)(0.1)(Y2O3)(0.01), (ZrO2)(0.90)(Sc2O3)(0.09)(Tb2O3)(0.01), and (ZrO2)(0.89)(Sc2O3)(0.1)(Gd2O3)(0.01).

One of the critical concerns, however, is the spectrum scarcity, due to the unprecedented broadcast penetration rate nowadays. Based on this, visible light communication (VLC) has recently emerged as a viable solution to secure high-speed communications. VLC, a high data rate communication technology, has proven its stature as a promising complementary to its radio frequency (RF) counterpart. VLC is a cost-effective, energy-efficient, and secure technology that exploits the current infrastructure, specifically within indoor and underwater environments. Yet, despite their appealing capabilities, VLC systems face several limitations which constraint their potentials such as LED's limited bandwidth, dimming, flickering, line-of-sight (LOS) requirement, impact of harsh weather conditions, noise, interference, shadowing, transceiver alignment, signal decoding complexity, and mobility issue. Consequently, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has been considered an effective technique to circumvent these shortcomings. The NOMA scheme has emerged as a revolutionary paradigm to address the shortcomings of VLC systems. The potentials of NOMA are to increase the number of users, system's capacity, massive connectivity, and enhance the spectrum and energy efficiency in future communication scenarios. Motivated by this, the presented study offers an overview of NOMA-based VLC systems. This article provides a broad scope of existing research activities of NOMA-based VLC systems. This article aims to provide firsthand knowledge of the prominence of NOMA and VLC and surveys several NOMA-enabled VLC systems.

Furthermore, we focus on NOMA-based hybrid RF/VLC networks and discuss the role of machine learning (ML) tools and physical layer security (PLS) in this domain. In addition, this study also highlights diverse and significant technical hindrances prevailing in NOMA-based VLC systems. We highlight future research directions, along with provided insights that are envisioned to be helpful towards the effective practical deployment of such systems. In a nutshell, this review highlights the existing and ongoing research activities for NOMA-based VLC systems, which will provide sufficient guidelines for research communities working in this domain and it will pave the way for successful deployment of these systems.;"[Mohsan, Syed Agha Hassnain; Li, Yanlong] Zhejiang Univ, Ocean Coll, Opt Commun Lab, Zheda Rd 1, Zhoushan 316021, Peoples R China; [Sadiq, Muhammad] Shenzhen Inst Informat Technol, Shenzhen 518172, Peoples R China; [Li, Yanlong] Guilin Univ Elect Technol, Key Lab Cognit Radio & Informat Proc, Minist Educ, Guilin 541004, Peoples R China; [Shvetsov, Alexey V.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Smart Technol, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Shvetsov, Alexey V.] North Eastern Fed Univ, Fac Rd Transport, Yakutsk 107023, Russia; [Shvetsova, Svetlana V.] Sch Comp, Khabarovsk 107023, Russia; [Shafiq, Muhammad] Guangzhou Univ, Cyberspace Inst Adv Technol, Guangzhou 510006, Peoples R China";"Zhejiang University; Shenzhen Institute of Information Technology; Guilin University of Electronic Technology; Moscow Polytechnic University; North-Eastern Federal University in Yakutsk; Guangzhou University";Sadiq, M (автор для корреспонденции), Shenzhen Inst Informat Technol, Shenzhen 518172, Peoples R China.;muhammad.sadiq@crids.org;"Mohsan, Syed Agha Hassnain/AAF-4602-2021; Shvetsov, Alexey Vladislavovich/R-2057-2019; Shafiq, Muhammad/AFG-7971-2022; Shvetsova, Svetlana Valerievna/IQS-6648-2023";"Mohsan, Syed Agha Hassnain/0000-0002-5810-4983; Shvetsov, Alexey Vladislavovich/0000-0002-4455-0296; Shafiq, Muhammad/0000-0003-1909-9373; Li, Yanlong/0000-0002-1144-8789";"National Natural Science Foundation of China [62261009]; Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Cognitive Radio and Information Processing [CRKL200106]";"National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Cognitive Radio and Information Processing";This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under grant 62261009, Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Cognitive Radio and Information Processing (CRKL200106).;;166;3;3;11;12;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;1424-8220;;SENSORS-BASEL;Sensors;MAR;2023;23;6;;;;;;;2960;10.3390/s23062960;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s23062960;;;30;"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation";C0JR5;36991671;Green Published, gold;;;2023-12-25;WOS:000958891500001;View Full Record in Web of Science

According to experts, to adapt and respond to uninterrupted technological progress in the future, people will alternately master about 10 professions throughout their lives. Today, as in the last 5-7 years, the demand for IT specialists is actively developing, to a greater extent for system and computer developers and analysts, and security experts. Modern employers point out that development skills along with easy learning new things are the priority qualities of potential employees. In addition: the ability to correctly respond to the introduced technological changes; communication skills not only within a single specialty, but also far beyond its framework; processing the large information volumes.

The authors proposed to analyze not only TBC but also EBC from the point of view of the optics of semitransparent scattering and absorbing media in the range of similar to 0.4-4 mu m of external radiant action. This paradigm allows us to continue the study of ceramic fibers embedded in ceramic matrix CMCs (C/C, C/SiC, SiC/SiC) as a traditional class of opaque materials. However, at the same time, mullites, Al2O3/Al2O3 have been reviewed as a class of semitransparent elements for designing CMCs. The relevance of studying the effect of oriented fibers on the formation of thermoradiation and temperature fields in a semitransparent material was noted. Modeling the scattering asymmetry coefficient influence (scattering phase function) on the generation of the subsurface thermal radiation source was carried out. The methodology for calculating the thermoradiative field in a semitransparent medium (with relative absorption, scattering indexes, and scattering asymmetry coefficient) was used under a one-dimensional two-flux model as the first approximation for solving the radiative heat transfer equation. Calculations of temperature profiles in opaque and semitransparent ceramics were presented under heat load typical for the combustion chambers operating regime of diesel and gas turbine engines.;"[Merzlikin, Vladimir; Dokukina, Anna] Plekhanov Russian Univ Econ, Dept Econ Ind, Stremyanny 36, Moscow 117997, Russia; [Merzlikin, Vladimir; Parshina, Svetlana] Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Technol & Equipment Mech Engn, Bolshaya Semenovskaya 38, Moscow 111116, Russia; [Safonov, Evgeny] Moscow Polytech Univ, Fac Mech Engn, Bolshaya Semenovskaya 38, Moscow 111116, Russia; [Kostyukov, Andrey] Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Power Plants Transport & Small Scale Power Ge, Bolshaya Semenovskaya 38, Moscow 111116, Russia";"Plekhanov Russian University of Economics; Moscow Polytechnic University; Moscow Polytechnic University; Moscow Polytechnic University";"Merzlikin, V (автор для корреспонденции), Plekhanov Russian Univ Econ, Dept Econ Ind, Stremyanny 36, Moscow 117997, Russia.;Merzlikin, V (автор для корреспонденции), Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Technol & Equipment Mech Engn, Bolshaya Semenovskaya 38, Moscow 111116, Russia.";merzlikinv@mail.ru;;"Safonov, Evgeniy/0000-0001-8155-2971; kostukov, andrei/0000-0001-5428-0536";;;;;34;0;0;1;2;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;2571-6131;;;CERAMICS-BASEL;Ceramics-Switzerland;MAR;2023;6;1;;;;;717;733;;10.3390/ceramics6010044;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ceramics6010044;;;17;"Materials Science, Ceramics; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary";Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI);Materials Science;A4UV9;;gold;;;2023-12-25;WOS:000955102200001;View Full Record in Web of Science

The fire hazard increases with an increase in the mining depth. Currently, most accidents in coal mines are mine fires. The cost of eliminating mine fires is 80-95% of the cost of eliminating all accidents occurring at mining enterprises. Therefore, the problem of developing a new methodology for modeling the ventilation network parameters of the mine to increase the reliability of controlling the aerogas mode at the excavation site is very relevant. The comprehensive analysis and assessment of gas-dynamic processes in coalmines under study were carried out using the methods of probability theory and mathematical statistics. Spatial data were processed using spline interpolation in gnuplot. As a result, a generalized expression for the transfer functions of coalmine objects, taking into account delays, was developed, including the description of dynamic properties of mining sites under various operating modes. The principal possibility of using a graphical method for estimating additional parameters of the sections of the ventilation system branches has been proved due to the alignment of their profiles at an equivalent distance relative to an arbitrary analogue. The improved method of spatial modeling was used to determine the gas-dynamic characteristics through additive gas-dynamic processes. The studies have been carried out and the method for managing the process of changing connections between devices (controllers-switches) of the technical system was developed in order to obtain greater reliability for safe mining. In subsequent studies, there is an issue of more detailed clarification of the peculiarities concerning the interrelations between the studied parameters in several projections of the response space.;"[Bosikov, Igor Ivanovich] State Technol Univ, North Caucasian Inst Min & Met, Dept Informat Technol & Syst, 44 Nikolaev Str, Vladikavkaz 362011, Russia; [Martyushev, Nikita V.] Tomsk Polytech Univ, Dept Adv Technol, 30 Lenin Ave, Tomsk 634050, Russia; [Klyuev, Roman V.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Tech & Technol Min & Oil & Gas Prod Dept, 33 B Semenovskaya Str, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Savchenko, Irina A.] Moscow City Univ, Dept Philosophy & Social Sci, Moscow 129226, Russia; [Savchenko, Irina A.] Linguist Univ Nizhny Novgorod, Int Lab Res Methods Social Sci, Nizhnii Novgorod 603155, Russia; [Kukartsev, Vladislav V.] Reshetnev Siberian State Univ Sci & Technol, Inst Engn & Econ, Dept Informat Econ Syst, Krasnoyarsk 660037, Russia; [Kukartsev, Vladislav V.] Siberian Fed Univ, Inst Space & Informat Technol, Dept Informat, Krasnoyarsk 660041, Russia; [Kukartsev, Vladislav V.] Bauman Moscow State Tech Univ, Digital Mat Sci New Mat & Technol, Moscow 105005, Russia; [Kukartsev, Viktor A.] Siberian Fed Univ, Polytech Inst, Dept Mat Sci & Mat Proc Technol, Krasnoyarsk 660041, Russia; [Tynchenko, Yadviga A.] Siberian Fed Univ, Lab Biofuel Composit, Krasnoyarsk 660041, Russia; [Tynchenko, Yadviga A.] Reshetnev Siberian State Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Syst Anal & Operat Res, Krasnoyarsk 660037, Russia";"North Caucasian Institute of Mining & Metallurgy (State Technological University); Tomsk Polytechnic University; Moscow Polytechnic University; Moscow City University; Reshetnev Siberian State University of Science & Technology; Siberian Federal University; Bauman Moscow State Technical University; Siberian Federal University; Siberian Federal University; Reshetnev Siberian State University of Science & Technology";Martyushev, NV (автор для корреспонденции), Tomsk Polytech Univ, Dept Adv Technol, 30 Lenin Ave, Tomsk 634050, Russia.;martjushev@tpu.ru;"Klyuev, Roman/J-8000-2014; Kukartsev, Vladislav/U-6956-2019; Savchenko, Irina/B-1076-2016; Klyuev, Roman Vladimirovich/AAX-6549-2021; Martyushev, Nikita/AAO-2653-2020";"Klyuev, Roman/0000-0003-3777-7203; Kukartsev, Vladislav/0000-0001-6382-1736; Klyuev, Roman Vladimirovich/0000-0003-3777-7203; Martyushev, Nikita/0000-0003-0620-9561";;;;;47;35;35;19;21;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;2571-6255;;;FIRE-BASEL;Fire-Switzerland;MAR;2023;6;3;;;;;;;95;10.3390/fire6030095;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fire6030095;;;12;"Ecology; Forestry";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry";A5NO5;;gold, Green Published;;;2023-12-25;WOS:000955589000001;View Full Record in Web of Science

The study is aimed at finding affordable approaches for the shaping of two different narrow-fraction fillers: F240 electro-corundum and hollow alumina microspheres. The results revealed the influence of accessible shaping techniques (semi-dry pressing, direct casting, and slip casting) on the structural and mechanical properties of porous alumina ceramics. The starting materials were characterized by XRD, SEM, EDX, and BET. The manufactured ceramics were studied in terms of microstructure, density, porosity, and flexural strength. Free stacking of the fillers' particles during the direct and slip casting resulted in a higher porosity of ceramics compared with that of semi-dry pressing, while reducing its mechanical strength. Direct casting appeared preferable for ceramics with hollow microspheres because it maintained the integrity of the filler particles and preserved their inherent porosity in the ceramics. The optimal parameters for porous ceramics processing were determined as follows: pressing at 30 MPa and sintering at 1280-1320 degrees C with a bentonite content of 15 wt.%. In this case, the average density and open porosity of F240 samples reached 2.22 g cm(-3) and 40.4%, while samples containing hollow microspheres reached 2.20 g cm(-3) and 36.7%, respectively.;"[Smirnov, Aleksey D.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Ctr Collect Usage High Tech Chem Technol, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Kholodkova, Anastasia A.] Moscow MV Lomonosov State Univ, Chem Dept, Moscow 119991, Russia; [Rybalchenko, Viktor V.; Tarasovskii, Vadim P.] MIREA Russian Technol Univ, Mobile Solut Engn Ctr, Moscow 119454, Russia";"Moscow Polytechnic University; Lomonosov Moscow State University; MIREA - Russian Technological University";Kholodkova, AA (автор для корреспонденции), Moscow MV Lomonosov State Univ, Chem Dept, Moscow 119991, Russia.;anastasia.kholodkoval@gmail.com;;;;;;;59;1;1;1;3;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;2571-6131;;;CERAMICS-BASEL;Ceramics-Switzerland;MAR;2023;6;1;;;;;132;145;;10.3390/ceramics6010009;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ceramics6010009;;;14;"Materials Science, Ceramics; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary";Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI);Materials Science;A3NQ3;;gold;;;2023-12-25;WOS:000954236800001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Most of the techniques used for this purpose are based on theoretical studies. These studies suggest that the observed diffraction patterns are caused by random stacking faults in crystals. In reality, however, the condition of randomness for stacking faults may be violated. The purpose of the study was to develop a technique that can be used to calculate the diffraction effects of the axis of the thin plates of twin, new phases, as well as other variations in defective structures. Materials and methods. This was achieved through modern X-ray diffraction methods using differential equations (transformations and Fourier transforms) and the construction of the Ewald sphere, mathematical analysis, mathematical logic, and mathematical modeling (complex Markov chain). Conclusion. The study made it possible to develop a technique for the calculation of the diffraction effects of the axis of the thin plates of twin, new phases and other variations in defective structures. The technique makes it possible to solve several complex, urgent problems related to the calculation of X-ray diffraction for crystals with face-centered lattices containing different types of stacking faults. At the same time, special attention was paid to the correlations between the relative positions of faults. The calculations showed that the proposed method can help to determine the nature and structure of stacking faults by identifying the partial and vertex dislocations limiting them in twin crystals with a face-centered cubic structure of silicon carbide based on X-ray diffraction analysis.;"[Bosikov, Igor I.

This study develops a system for the automated analysis and calculation of feasible boiler unit loads, defined according to the criterion of the minimum cost of live steam in a separate steam plant pipeline. The calculations consider the balance limit on the steam, the boiler unit's wear and tear, performance specifications, and economic indicators of fuel consumption in the calculation. The software also defines the optimal fuel mix composition when forecasting the operating modes of the power plant boiler units in real-time mode. The calculation algorithm is based on the dynamic programming technique combined with the sequential equivalenting method, which ensures the convergence of calculations. When a steam plant model is developed, much attention is paid to the thermal scheme and technical and economic specifications of boiler units. In the system, the boiler models are set as a table containing the ratio between the boiler unit's steam capacity and energy consumption while considering the cost of a ton of live steam with the specified parameters. The key economic effect of implementing the system is determined by reducing the fuel cost due to its rational redistribution between the power plant boiler units.

AMC with 0.5 wt% nanodiamonds addition was prepared by mechanical mixing, while AMC with 0.5 wt% of multi-layered graphene was prepared by electrochemical deposition. Initial powders for LPBF were thoroughly characterized and op-timal LPBF parameters were found based on the relative density analysis and optical microscopy. Processing windows of both AMCs moved towards lower energy density possibly due to the increased total absorptivity of the powders. Raman spectroscopy results, SEM and HRTEM studies of samples after LPBF demonstrated the absence of nano-diamond in the structure after processing which is explained by graphitization of the nanodiamond particles during laser melting. In case of AMC with graphene additives, carbon-containing particles remained in the structure with partial in situ formation of Al4C3, along with a noticeable strengthening effect, which increased material's microhardness by more than 40% compared to the initial AlSi10Mg alloy. The strengthening effect is explained by the presence of a network of graphene and Al4C3 particles across the solidified melt-pool promoting the Orowan strengthening mechanism. (c) 2023 The Authors.

The aim of the research is to study the compressibility of composite materials obtained by varying the degree of impregnation of a non-woven needle-punched cloth with an aqueous dispersion of polyurethane. Materials and research methods. Non-woven needle-punched cloth made of polyethylene terephthalate fibers (TU 6- 13-0204077-95-91) with a linear density of 0.33 tex (diameter 20-25 microns) was used as objects of research. For impregnation, an aqueous dispersion of anionic stabilized aliphatic polyethiruretane of the brand IMPRANIL DL 1380 (PRC) with a dry residue of 40% was used. The compressibility of canvases and composite materials was established using the ICH indicator according to GOST 577-68 with an accuracy of measuring the thickness of +/- 0.001 mm. Results and discussion. An approach is proposed to establish the relationship between the degree of compressibility of composite materials and the load and to obtain an equation for predicting the degree of compressibility of composite materials from the degree of impregnation and load. Optimal loading conditions of the composite material with a minimum degree of compressibility has been established. Conclusion. The optimal degree of impregnation of a non-woven needle-punched fabric made of polyethylene terephthalate fibers with a diameter of 20-25 microns with polyurethane dispersion is 0.5.;"[Nazarov, Victor G.; Dedov, Alexander, V] Moscow Polytech Univ, Moscow, Russia; [Bokova, Elena S.] Kosygin Russian State Univ, Moscow, Russia";"Moscow Polytechnic University; Kosygin State University of Russia";Dedov, AV (автор для корреспонденции), Moscow Polytech Univ, Moscow, Russia.;"110505n@gmail.com; dedovs55@rambler.ru; esbokova@ya.ru";"Dedov, Alexander/JAN-8989-2023; Nazarov, Victor/B-2274-2014";"Nazarov, Victor/0000-0002-7243-9739; , Aleksandr/0000-0001-9636-9467";;;;;27;0;0;0;0;NANOSTROITEL STVO;MOSCOW;GAZETNYI PER-K, DOM 9, STR 4, MOSCOW, 125009, RUSSIA;2075-8545;;;NANOTECHNOL CONSTR;Nanotechnol.

The following tasks were carried out: mathematical mod-eling of thermohydraulic processes in different slot channels having constant height along them (from 0.3 mm to 0.5 mm); analysis of the influence of the slit channels' height, the number of distancing el-ements in rows, the distance between rows and the total number of elements on the average value of the Nusselt number and on the pressure drop; analysis of the effect of changes in speed and tempera-ture conditions on thermal and hydraulic characteristics. The most important results are the following facts: the influence of the relative location of the distancing elements on the thermohydraulic charac-teristics of the flow is negligible; changes in the temperature and speed regime of the laminar flow practically does not affect the intensity of convection in the matrix channels; an increase in the height of the slot channel leads to a relatively small decrease in the average value of the Nusselt number. The significance of the results obtained is that they can be the basis for adjusting the methods of de-sign calculations of rotary heat exchangers taking into account the decrease in thermal efficiency caused by the presence of distancing elements in the channels of their matrices.

The following approaches were used in the study: computational, classification, and car-tographic methods, aerospace, geoinformation technologies. The research uses a five-level framework for defining final ecosystem services. Such framework can be applied on specific territories if transformed according to the following scheme: type of a class-class-group-division-section. This scheme allows one to specify the indicators of an ecosystem service and clarify its functions at each hierarchical level. To improve objectivity of area's ecological integrity evaluation, as well as accuracy and complete-ness of input materials for further evaluation of ecosystem services, it is proposed to determine the degree of ecological stability, the level of envi-ronmental risk and the degree of anthropogenic impact as basic indicators of the studied region. The approach is applied for the territory of an aver-age village council. The implementation of a donor-recipient system of interregional relations is proposed for two ecosystem services: prevention of water erosion and recreation. Using cartographic materials and historical archival aerospace images for desktop and field research on the assessment of ecosystem services reduces the time used for this work. Developing and implementing land consolidation projects somewhat neutralize the negative effects of fragmentation and the existing inconsistency of administrative boundaries and ecosystems.

Ultrathin nonwoven fabrics are produced for many applications: biomedical, nanosensors, tissue engineering and filtration systems. In this work, nonwoven polylactide, polylactide/natural rubber, poly-3-hydroxybutyrate, and poly-3-hydroxybutyrate/nitrile butadiene rubber fabrics were prepared by electrospinning methods. The obtained fabric samples were used as substrates for the growth of winter wheat seeds Yubileinaya 100 (Triticum aestivum L.). The stimulating effect of polymer substrates on seed germination and plant growth was shown. The structure and properties of nonwoven agromaterials were controlled by differential scanning calorimetry, IR-spectroscopy, and optical microscopy. The mechanical properties of the obtained fabrics before and after their utilization as substrates were studied. After the wheat growing experiment, the degree of crystallinity of PHB and PHB/NBR samples decreased by 12% and they completely lost their mechanical properties. It is shown that the main factors providing the efficiency of seed growth technology on polymer substrates are the chemical nature and structure of the biodegradable matrix.;"[Tertyshnaya, Yulia Victorovna; Podzorova, Maria Victorovna; Varyan, Ivetta Aramovna] Russian Acad Sci, Emanuel Inst Biochem Phys, 4 Kosygina Str, Moscow 119334, Russia; [Tertyshnaya, Yulia Victorovna; Podzorova, Maria Victorovna; Varyan, Ivetta Aramovna] Plekhanov Russian Univ Econ, Lab Adv Composite Mat & Technol, 36 Stremyanny per, Moscow 117997, Russia; [Tertyshnaya, Yulia Victorovna; Podzorova, Maria Victorovna] Fed Res Agroengn Ctr VIM, 1st Institutskiy Proezd,5, Moscow 109428, Russia; [Tcherdyntsev, Victor Victorovich; Zadorozhnyy, Mikhail Yurievich] Natl Univ Sci & Technol MISIS, Lab Funct Polymer Mat, Leninskii prosp,4, Moscow 119049, Russia; [Zadorozhnyy, Mikhail Yurievich] Moscow Polytech Univ, Ctr Project Act, Bolshaya Semenovskaya st,2, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Medvedeva, Elena Valerievna] Moscow Inst Aviat Technol, Volokolamsk sh,4, Moscow 125993, Russia";"Russian Academy of Sciences; Emanuel Institute of Biochemical Physics; Plekhanov Russian University of Economics; National University of Science & Technology (MISIS); Moscow Polytechnic University; Moscow Aviation Institute";"Podzorova, MV (автор для корреспонденции), Russian Acad Sci, Emanuel Inst Biochem Phys, 4 Kosygina Str, Moscow 119334, Russia.;Podzorova, MV (автор для корреспонденции), Plekhanov Russian Univ Econ, Lab Adv Composite Mat & Technol, 36 Stremyanny per, Moscow 117997, Russia.;Podzorova, MV (автор для корреспонденции), Fed Res Agroengn Ctr VIM, 1st Institutskiy Proezd,5, Moscow 109428, Russia.;Tcherdyntsev, VV (автор для корреспонденции), Natl Univ Sci & Technol MISIS, Lab Funct Polymer Mat, Leninskii prosp,4, Moscow 119049, Russia.";"mariapdz@mail.ru; vvch@misis.ru";"Tcherdyntsev, Victor V/E-4270-2014; Podzorova, Mariya/E-4305-2016; Zadorozhnyy, Mikhail/A-7111-2014";"Tertyshnaya, Yulia/0000-0001-8886-4513; Tcherdyntsev, Victor/0000-0003-4357-4509; Podzorova, Mariya/0000-0001-9023-3876; Zadorozhnyy, Mikhail/0000-0001-8776-0595";"Ministry of Science and Higher Education of Russia [075-00268-20-02]; Moscow Polytechnic University; [718/20]; [0718-2020-0036]";"Ministry of Science and Higher Education of Russia; Moscow Polytechnic University; ;";The work was carried out using the scientific equipment of the Center of Shared Usage New Materials and Technologies of the Emanuel Institute of Biochemical Physics RAS and the Joint Research Center of the Plekhanov Russian University of Economics.

However, this rapid advancement is also polluting our air ambience. Hence real-time detection and estimation of hazardous gases/odors in the air ambiance has become a critical need. In this paper, a convolutional neural network (CNN) based multi-element gas sensor arrays signature response analysis approach has been presented to achieve higher accuracy in detection and estimation of hazardous gases. Accordingly, the real-time gas sensor array responses are spatially upscaled and processed on the edge, using lightweight CNNs. For the verification of our hypothesis, we have used a four-element metal oxide semi-conductor (MOS)-based thick-film gas sensor array, fabricated by our group, by using SnO2, ZnO, MoO, CdS materials for detection and estimation of four target hazardous gases, viz., acetone, carbon-tetrachloride, ethyl-methyl-ketone, and xylene. The four-element (2 x 2) raw sensor responses are first upscaled to 6 x 6 responses and a lightweight CNN is trained on 42 samples of 6 x 6 input vectors. The trained system is then tested using 16 unknown (not used during training) test samples of the considered gases/odors. All the 16 test samples are detected correctly. The Mean Squared Error (MSEs) of detection has been 1.42 x 10(-14 )while the estimation accuracy of 2.43 x 10(-3) were achieved for the considered gases.

A reference trajectory of the robot's movement is needed to estimate errors and evaluate a quality of the localization. In this article, we propose the Prior Distribution Refinement method for generating a reference trajectory of a mobile robot with the Monte Carlo-based localization system. The proposed approach can be applied for both indoor and outdoor environments of an arbitrary size without the need for expensive position tracking sensors or intervention in the testing infrastructure. The reference trajectory is generated by running the algorithm over a so-called Particles' Transition Graph, obtained from a resampling stage of Monte Carlo localization. The prior distribution of particles is then refined by forward-backward propagation through the graph and exploring the connections between particles. The Viterbi algorithm is applied afterwards to generate a reference trajectory based on refined particles' distribution. We demonstrate that such an approach is capable of generating accurate estimates of a mobile robot's position and orientation with the only requirement of moderate quality of localization system being used as a core algorithm for iterative optimization.;"[Griguletskii, Mark; Shipitko, Oleg; Abramov, Maxim; Pristanskiy, Egor; Kibalov, Vladislav; Grigoryev, Anton] Evocargo LLC, Moscow 129085, Russia; [Shipitko, Oleg; Abramov, Maxim; Kibalov, Vladislav; Grigoryev, Anton] RAS, Inst Informat Transmiss Problems IITP, Moscow 127051, Russia; [Griguletskii, Mark] Skolkovo Inst Sci & Technol, Moscow 121205, Russia; [Pristanskiy, Egor] Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Appl Math & Comp Sci, Moscow 121205, Russia";"Russian Academy of Sciences; Skolkovo Institute of Science & Technology; Moscow Polytechnic University";"Griguletskii, M (автор для корреспонденции), Evocargo LLC, Moscow 129085, Russia.;Griguletskii, M (автор для корреспонденции), Skolkovo Inst Sci & Technol, Moscow 121205, Russia.";mark.griguletskii@skoltech.ru;;;EVOCARGO LLC;EVOCARGO LLC;This work was supported by the EVOCARGO LLC.;;32;0;0;2;5;IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC;PISCATAWAY;445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA;2169-3536;;;IEEE ACCESS;IEEE Access;;2023;11;;;;;;19093;19102;;10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3247503;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3247503;;;10;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications";9M5DV;;gold;;;2023-12-25;WOS:000942251100001;View Full Record in Web of Science

When modeling thermal loads, film conductors on silicon with a thickness of up to 3 mu m and a width of 10-75 mu m were considered. Based on the experimental oscillograms taken from sections of the test structures during the passage of a current pulse and the calculation performed, the maximum temperatures on the silicon surface near the thermal shock source were determined. It has been experimentally revealed that the passage of current pulses with an amplitude of 2 x 10(11) A/m(2) and a duration of up to 250 mu s leads to thermal destruction of interconnects and contributes to the formation of plastic deformation regions in the near-surface layer of silicon. It was revealed that with a decrease in the track width, the nature of the melting of the film conductor does not change. It was also established that a significantly higher specific energy is required to melt narrower tracks. The analysis of the maximum temperature gradients identified the places of the most probable cracking. The formation of cracks in the near-surface layer of a semiconductor at a depth of 2.5 mu m after the passage of a single current pulse was experimentally detected.

Metallurgical plants require a solution to implement in the rolling mill retrofitting. A conceptual approach to the virtual configuration of industrial mechatronic complexes based on object-oriented digital twins-prototypes and twins-instances of electromechanical and hydraulic systems is justified. Alternative options for virtual commissioning (VC) were considered, and the Hardware-In-The-Loop (HIL) option was adopted, involving the implementation of DTs in the hardware and software of a programmable logic controller (PLC). Virtual models were built, and control algorithms were tested in the Matlab Simulink software; the prospect of using Simscape domains was noted. The paper's contribution is the description of a methodology for the development of object-oriented DTs, interlinked in the process, exemplified by a rolling mill coiler. The results of the control over the 'virtual reeling' mode are provided; the adequacy of real and virtual processes is confirmed. The problem of developing DTs for a coiler group, solved herein, is a fragment of a large-scale scientific and practical problem of developing DTAs (digital twin aggregates) for interconnected mechatronic rolling mill complexes.

The program allows us to calculate drawing stress, drawing force, tensile strength and yield strength of the alloy after wire drawing, safety factor, and drawing power. The developed mathematical model differs in that it allows us to evaluate the uniformity of deformation over the wire section, depending on the technological parameters of the deformation zone, namely, the semi-angular die, the coefficient of friction and the degree of deformation. To select the technological parameters of the deformation zone, which ensure uniform deformation over the wire cross-section, a nomogram was compiled. The equations of hardening during nickel NP2 wire drawing are obtained. The calculation of energy-power parameters of drawing nickel NP2 (Ni 99.6) wire null 1.8 mm from null 4.94 mm wire rod is given. Experimental studies have been carried out to determine the energy-power parameters of nickel wire drawing on a laboratory drawing machine with an installed ring strain gauge to determine the drawing force. A change in the friction coefficient by 0.02 when drawing nickel wire leads to an increase in stress and drawing force by 20%. To improve the accuracy of the developed mathematical model, it is shown that in the future, it would be necessary to conduct experimental studies on a laboratory drawing machine to determine the effect on the energy-power parameters of the drawing process of the values of technological parameters entered into the program as constant real values, such as the friction coefficient, die half-angle, drawing speed, and back tension.;"[Radionova, Liudmila V.; Gromov, Dmitry V.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Met, Bolshaya Semyonovskaya Str 38, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Lisovskiy, Roman A.; Erdakov, Ivan N.] South Ural State Univ, Dept Met Forming, Lenin Prospect 76, Chelyabinsk 454080, Russia";"Moscow Polytechnic University; South Ural State University";Radionova, LV (автор для корреспонденции), Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Met, Bolshaya Semyonovskaya Str 38, Moscow 107023, Russia.;radionovalv@rambler.ru;Radionova, Liudmila V./K-2444-2015;"Radionova, Liudmila V./0000-0001-9587-2925; Erdakov, Ivan/0000-0003-2005-4439";;;;;45;0;0;3;4;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;2075-1702;;MACHINES;Machines;FEB;2023;11;2;;;;;;;252;10.3390/machines11020252;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/machines11020252;;;13;"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Engineering, Mechanical";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Engineering;9K4DD;;gold;;;2023-12-25;WOS:000940819300001;View Full Record in Web of Science

This problem is relevant for rolling mills, which provide the output and determine the quality of products of metallurgical companies. Making up monitoring systems requires the development of digital shadows and coordinate observers, the direct measurement of which is either impossible or associated with numerous difficulties. These coordinates include the spindle torque applied by the spring-transmitting torque from the motor to the rolling stand rolls. The development and research are conducted by the example of the electromechanical systems of the horizontal stand at the plate mill 5000. The stand electric drive characteristics are given, and the emergency modes that cause mechanical equipment breakdowns are analyzed that. The relevance of analyzing transient torque processes in emergency modes has been accentuated. The paper points to the shortcomings of the system for elastic torque direct measurement, including low durability due to the harsh operating conditions of precision sensors. It also highlights the need to install the measuring equipment after each spindle. The disadvantage of the previously developed observer is the function of calculating the electric drive speed derivative. This causes a decrease in noise immunity and signal recovery accuracy. The contribution of this paper is building a digital elastic torque observer that has advantages over conventional technical solutions, based on the theoretical and experimental studies. The technique for virtual observer adjustment was developed and tested in the Matlab-Simulink software package. For the first time, a comprehensive analysis was conducted for spindle elastic torques in emergency modes that caused equipment damage. An algorithm was developed for an emergency shutdown of a stand electric drive in the worst-case mode of strip retraction between work and backup rolls, due to the overlap of the strip on the roll. Further, the algorithm was tested experimentally. The criteria for diagnosing pre-emergencies was then justified. An adaptive motor-braking rate controller was developed. The developed observer and emergency braking system are in operation at the mill 5000. Long experimental research proved the efficiency of dynamic load monitoring and the reduction in the number of equipment breakdowns.;"[Gasiyarov, Vadim R.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Automation & Control, 38, Bolshaya Semyonovskaya Str, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Radionov, Andrey A.; Karandaev, Alexander S.; Khramshin, Vadim R.] Nosov Magnitogorsk State Tech Univ, Power Engn & Automated Syst Inst, 38, Lenin Ave, Magnitogorsk 455000, Russia; [Loginov, Boris M.] South Ural State Univ, Dept Mechatron & Automation, Chelyabinsk 454080, Russia; [Gasiyarova, Olga A.] LLC NPP Uchtekh Profi, Dept Mat Sci, 147, Kommuny Str, Chelyabinsk 454080, Russia";"Moscow Polytechnic University; Nosov Magnitogorsk State Technical University; South Ural State University";Radionov, AA (автор для корреспонденции), Nosov Magnitogorsk State Tech Univ, Power Engn & Automated Syst Inst, 38, Lenin Ave, Magnitogorsk 455000, Russia.;radionov.mail@gmail.com;"Khramshin, Vadim/A-6471-2014; Radionov, Andrey/P-4418-2015; Karandaev, Alexander Sergeevich/I-5687-2014; Gasiyarov, Vadim/D-5003-2015";"Khramshin, Vadim/0000-0003-0972-2803; Radionov, Andrey/0000-0002-3914-4429; Loginov, Boris/0000-0003-3337-3148; Karandaev, Alexander Sergeevich/0000-0002-2671-0241; Gasiyarov, Vadim/0000-0001-9635-4716";;;;;81;1;1;3;4;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;2504-4494;;J MANUF MATER PROC;J.

It proposes a new probe-coil magnetic-field NDT, not requiring the pre-magnetization of the test object material, which is mandatory for all conventional magnetic flaw detection techniques. A new bifactor excitation of the fluxgate sensor's sensitive element, based on double mu-transformation through the simultaneous activation of magnetic-modulating and electromagnetic-acoustic effects, is theoretically justified. The physical processes underlying the proposed technique are considered in detail, and a scheme for its practical implementation is described. The authors provide a variant of the new fluxgate's original design, implementing the proposed excitation technique. The specifics of implementing the fluxgate operating modes are analyzed, testifying to the possibility of detecting a given class of flaws with the required coverage as well as ensuring the required diagnostic resolution during flaw detection, which, in fact, indicates a more reliable identification of both the flaw type and location. Herewith, the new fluxgate type features the advantages of improved functionality and lower cost due to its simple design. The paper also considers a method to experimentally study the capabilities of the proposed fluxgate sensor with a new bifactor excitation in detail. The results of the experimental study into its key specifications are provided, confirming its high resolution, narrower zone of uncertainty, and the possibility of detecting smaller flaws at greater depths compared to available analogs.;"[Bryakin, Ivan V.] Natl Acad Sci Kyrgyz Republ, Lab Informat & Measuring Syst, Bishkek 720010, Kyrgyzstan; [Bochkarev, Igor V.] Kyrgyz State Tech Univ, Dept Electromech, Bishkek 720010, Kyrgyzstan; [Khramshin, Vadim R.] Nosov Magnitogorsk State Tech Univ, Power Engn & Automated Syst Inst, Magnitogorsk 455000, Russia; [Gasiyarov, Vadim R.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Automat & Control, Moscow 107023, Russia";"National Academy of Sciences of the Kyrgyz Republic (NAS KR); Razzakov Kyrgyz State Technical University; Nosov Magnitogorsk State Technical University; Moscow Polytechnic University";Gasiyarov, VR (автор для корреспонденции), Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Automat & Control, Moscow 107023, Russia.;gasiyarovvr@gmail.com;"Бочкарев, Игорь Викторович/HNS-4330-2023; Khramshin, Vadim/A-6471-2014; Gasiyarov, Vadim/D-5003-2015";"Бочкарев, Игорь Викторович/0000-0002-9873-9203; Khramshin, Vadim/0000-0003-0972-2803; Gasiyarov, Vadim/0000-0001-9635-4716; Bryakin, Ivan/0000-0001-7463-8072";;;;;31;0;0;5;9;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;1424-8220;;SENSORS-BASEL;Sensors;FEB;2023;23;4;;;;;;;1775;10.3390/s23041775;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s23041775;;;19;"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation";9J2BV;36850372;gold, Green Published;;;2023-12-25;WOS:000940000000001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Fast and efficient combustion synthesis (CS), spark plasma sintering (SPS), and reactive SPS (RSPS) methods were used to synthesize the HE powders and bulks. The formation of the main B2 phase along with some amounts of secondary BCC and FCC phases are reported, and L12 intermetallic (CS scheme) and BCC based on Cr (CS + SPS and RSPS schemes at 1000 degrees C) were observed in all samples. The interaction between the components during heating to 1600 degrees C of the mechanically activated mixtures and CS powders has been studied. It has been shown that the formation of the CoNi0.3Fe0.3Cr0.15Al phase occurs at 1370 degrees C through the formation of intermediate intermetallic phases (Al9Me2, AlCo, AlNi3) and their solid solutions, which coincidences well with thermodynamic calculations and solubility diagrams. Compression tests at room and elevated temperatures showed that the alloy obtained by the RSPS method has enhanced mechanical properties (sigma(p) = 2.79 GPa, sigma(0.2) = 1.82 GPa, epsilon = 11.5% at 400 degrees C) that surpass many known alloys in this system. High mechanical properties at elevated temperatures are provided by the B2 ordered phase due to the presence of impurity atoms and defects in the lattice.;"[Kuskov, Kirill Vasilevich; Nepapushev, Andrey A.

The developed technique for the bio-contamination degree quantifying, based on the computer analysis of the corresponding images, allowed us to establish that gas-phase fluorination of the surface approximately doubles the time during which the biofouling of LDPE, PP and UHMWPE with the mixed colony of Rivularia and Stigonema Minutum algae occurs under natural conditions.

Due to unique natural characteristics such as biocompatibility, non -toxicity, mechanical stability, and high moisture content, bacterial cellulose can be ef-ficiently used for the production of new medical materials, including various wound dressings. Bacterial cellulose can be produced by bacteria of the genera Gluconaceto-bacter, Aerobacter, Rhizobium and others. Under static cultivation conditions, the producers form gel films of bacterial cellulose, which differ in their properties. Bacte-rial cellulose does not possess inherent antimicrobial activity; therefore, bacterial cel-lulose films must be further enhanced before they are used as medical materials. In order to improve the properties of BC, researchers use various modification methods to introduce antimicrobial activity. The main attention is paid to the post-synthetic modification: in this concept, in order to impart antimicrobial properties to bacterial cellulose it is saturated with antibiotics or other antibacterial and antifungal drugs. To improve the sorption properties, successful attempts were made to oxidize BC and then to saturate it with an antibiotic. The introduction of new reactive functional groups to the surface of bacterial cellulose fibers will make it possible to better con-trol the sorption process and increase the saturation of films with antibacterial drugs. The purpose of this work was to determine the effect of bacterial cellulose treatment during oxidation in the TEMPO/NaClO/NaBr system on the properties of oxidized samples, i.e., an increase in the sorption capacity with respect to a biologically active compound. Films were obtained under conditions of stationary cultivation of the strain Gluconacetobacter hansenii GH 1/2008 (VKPM B-10547) on glucose and fruc-tose carbon sources. Chloramphenicol, a broad-spectrum antibiotic, was chosen as a model antibiotic with which the films were saturated. The resulting films did not dif-fer significantly in terms of thickness, water-holding capacity, and dry weight (see Table 1). Derivatives of BC gel films were obtained without destroying the native three-dimensional gel structure using an oxidative process catalyzed by the nitroxyl radical TEMPO (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-yl)oxyl). Depending on the oxidation conditions, a series of gel films functionalized with carboxyl groups (COOH) were obtained with a total content of COOH groups varying in a wide range from 0.041 to 0.219 mmol/g (see Fig. 2B). It was shown for the first time that the content of COOH groups depends on the quality of films synthesized on various carbon sources: the maximum degree of carboxylation was noted for films synthesized by G. hansenii on fructose, which is apparently associated with differences in the supramolecular struc-ture of cellulose (see Fig.2B and 3). For the obtained gel films, the sorption capacity with respect to the antibacterial drug chloramphenicol (CP) was evaluated. A direct relationship was established between the sorption value and the amount of COOH groups in the films. The amount of sorption of the antibiotic depends on the degree of carboxylation of the sample (see table 3). Thus, the functionalization of the surface of bacterial cellulose gel films with carboxyl groups leads to an increase in their sorption properties. Indeed, the amount of antibiotic absorbed by the oxidized films is several times higher as opposed to the non-oxidized gel films. The obtained results demon-strate the benefits of carrying out the process of oxidation of bacterial cellulose films, increasing the degree of their saturation with antimicrobial agents and the possibility of their further use for medical purposes as a dressing material.";"[Kober, Darya D.; Rubina, Margarita S.; Elmanovich, Igor V.; Grebenshchikov, Denis P.; Gromovykh, Tatiana I.] Russian Acad Sci, AN Nesmeyanov Inst Organoelement Cpds, Moscow, Russia; [Grebenshchikov, Denis P.; Gromovykh, Tatiana I.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Moscow, Russia";"Russian Academy of Sciences; Nesmeyanov Institute of Organoelement Compounds; Moscow Polytechnic University";Kober, DD (автор для корреспонденции), Russian Acad Sci, AN Nesmeyanov Inst Organoelement Cpds, Moscow, Russia.;"koberdarya@mail.ru; margorubina@yandex.ru; elmanovich@polly.phys.msu.ru; grebus21@mail.ru; gromovykhtatyana@mail.ru";;Grebensikov, Denis/0000-0002-0290-4412;basic part of the state assignment Moscow Polytechnic University [AAAA-A20-120092190052-9];basic part of the state assignment Moscow Polytechnic University;This work was partially supported by the basic part of the state assignment Moscow Polytechnic University (project AAAA-A20-120092190052-9).;;0;0;0;6;8;TOMSKIJ GOSUDARSTVENNYI UNIV;TOMSK;BIOL INST, 36 LENINA ST, TOMSK, 634050, RUSSIA;1998-8591;2311-2077;;VESTN TOMSK GOS U BI;Vestn.

To improve the mechanical properties, an alloy of the Al-Zn-Mg-Ca-Fe system was proposed. In this alloy, when Fe and Ca are added, compact particles of the Al10CaFe2 compound are formed, which significantly reduces the negative effect of Fe on the mechanical properties. Because of the high solidification rate (about 600 K/s) during cylindrical ingot (similar to 33 mm) production, the electromagnetic casting method (ECM) makes it possible to obtain a highly dispersed structure in the cast state. The size of the dendritic cell is similar to 7 mu m, while the entire amount of Fe is bound into eutectic inclusions of the Al10CaFe2 phase with an average size of less than 3 mu m. In this study, the effect of radial shear rolling (RSR) on the formation of the structure and hardening of the Al-8%Zn-3.3%Mg-0.8%Ca-1.1%Fe alloy obtained by EMC was studied. Computer simulation of the RSR process made it possible to analyze the temperature and stress-strain state of the alloy and to select the optimal rolling modes. It was shown that the flow features during RSR and the severe shear strains near the surface of the rod (10 mm) provided a refining and decrease in the size of the initial Fe-containing particles.;"[Gamin, Yury V.; Belov, Nikolay A.; Akopyan, Torgom K.; Cherkasov, Stanislav O.] Natl Univ Sci & Technol MISIS NUST MISIS, Dept Met Forming, 4 Leninsky Pr, Moscow 119049, Russia; [Akopyan, Torgom K.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Mat Sci, 38, Bolshaya Semyonovskaya Str, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Timofeev, Victor N.; Motkov, Mikhail M.] Siberian Fed Univ, Electrotech Dept, 79 Svobodny Pr, Krasnoyarsk 660041, Russia";"Moscow Polytechnic University; Siberian Federal University";Gamin, YV (автор для корреспонденции), Natl Univ Sci & Technol MISIS NUST MISIS, Dept Met Forming, 4 Leninsky Pr, Moscow 119049, Russia.;y.gamin@misis.ru;Belov, Nikolay A/A-7901-2014;Gamin, Yury/0000-0001-6654-4236;"Russian Science Foundation [22-19-00128]; Moscow Polytechnic University";"Russian Science Foundation(Russian Science Foundation (RSF)); Moscow Polytechnic University";The study was supported by a grant from the Russian Science Foundation (project no. 22-19-00128) (EMC, RSR, FEM, SEM) and by the Moscow Polytechnic University within the framework of the grant named after Pyotr Kapitsa (TEM, HV).;;36;1;1;0;8;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;1996-1944;;MATERIALS;Materials;JAN;2023;16;2;;;;;;;677;10.3390/ma16020677;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ma16020677;;;17;"Chemistry, Physical; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering; Physics, Applied; Physics, Condensed Matter";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Chemistry; Materials Science; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering; Physics";8R2MF;36676420;gold, Green Published;;;2023-12-25;WOS:000927729900001;View Full Record in Web of Science

The aim of the study is to develop environment-friendly and resource-saving technologies of extracting metals from sub-standard raw materials in underground mining of metallic mineral deposits Research methodology includes a set of methods that collectively define the feasibility of involvement in production of non-conforming metallic resources using hydrometallurgical technologies and increasing the extraction of metals compared to traditional washing technology. The main method is semi-experimental leaching of uranium ore in the pile. The results of the research allow us to optimize the organization of work on leaching metals by controlling the process parameters at all stages of leaching of off-grade mineral raw materials in the stacks with a differentiated assessment of the influence of major processes on leaching rates. The paper introduces the data on consumption of reagents and materials, extraction of metals into solution and out of solution and neutralization of the mother liquor. It is shown that leaching in the pile does not radically improve performance of traditional methods of extraction of metals, but only reduces the metal content in the secondary tails. The paper identifies the deficiencies of existing methods of assessing the impact of mining on the environment. The conclusion from the results of the study is that leaching in a stack does not solve the problem of non-waste, essentially increasing the exposure time of chemically hazardous products to living matter.;"[Golik, Vladimir, I] North Caucasian Min & Met Inst State Technol Univ, 44 Nikolaev Ave, Vladikavkaz 362021, Russia; [Golik, Vladimir, I] Moscow Polytech Univ, 38 B Semenovskaya St, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Razorenov, Yuri, I] South Russian State Polytech Univ, 132 Prosveshcheniya St, Novocherkassk 346428, Russia; [Mizik, Mikhail F.] DSTU Shakhty, Inst Serv & Entrepreneurship, 147 Shevchenko St, Shakhty 346527, Russia";"North Caucasian Institute of Mining & Metallurgy (State Technological University); Moscow Polytechnic University; Platov South Russian State Polytechnic University; Don State Technical University";"Golik, VI (автор для корреспонденции), North Caucasian Min & Met Inst State Technol Univ, 44 Nikolaev Ave, Vladikavkaz 362021, Russia.;Golik, VI (автор для корреспонденции), Moscow Polytech Univ, 38 B Semenovskaya St, Moscow 107023, Russia.";"v.i.golik@mail.ru; yiri1963@mail.ru; m_mits@mail.ru";;;;;;;24;0;0;0;0;TOMSK POLYTECHNIC UNIV, PUBLISHING HOUSE;TOMSK;30, LENIN AVE, TOMSK, 634050, RUSSIA;2500-1019;2413-1830;;BULL TOMSK POLYTECH;Bull.

The purpose of the article is to investigate changes in the established global trends in tourism under the influence of restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The study presents an analysis of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the tourism industry. The macrotrends in tourism before the introduction of restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the trends that emerged in tourism in the course of the pandemic are identified. The study suggests that the trends that made their appearance in tourism during the pandemic can contribute to the industry's recovery from the crisis in the post-pandemic period. At the same time, the prospects for the tourism sector remain extremely unclear. The changes brought about by the pandemic force the authorities of virtually all countries of the world, especially those in which tourism is quite a significant sphere of development, to take a different approach to the formation of strategies and programs for the development of the tourism industry.;"[Saenko, Natalya] Moscow Polytech Univ, Moscow, Russia; [Shubtsova, Lyudmila] Financial Univ Govt Russian Federat, Moscow, Russia; [Khmelev, Igor] Plekhanov Russian Univ Econ, Moscow, Russia; [Otcheskiy, Ivan; Sakhno, Aleksandr] Tyumen State Univ, Tyumen, Russia; [Sinyukov, Vasily] Khabarovsk State Univ Econ & Law, Khabarovsk, Russia";"Moscow Polytechnic University; Financial University Under the Government of Russian Federation; Plekhanov Russian University of Economics; Tyumen State University";Saenko, N (автор для корреспонденции), Moscow Polytech Univ, Moscow, Russia.;"rilke@list.ru; shubtsova.l.v@mail.ru; ibhmelev_hs1957@mail.ru; otcheskiy-ie@mail.ru; sssomsk@mail.ru; v.sinukov@yandex.ru";;;;;;;32;2;2;0;2;UNIV FEDERAL JUIZ FORA, CAMPUS UNIV;JUIZ DE FORA;CEP 36036-330, JUIZ DE FORA, MG 00000, BRAZIL;2238-2925;;;AN BRAS ESTUD TURIST;An.

The modeling of metal leaching processes using mechanical activation of polymetallic raw material components is particularly important in expanding the application of mining tailings as inert fillers of filling mixtures. This study is aimed at detecting the rotor speed factor on the chemical and mechanochemical effect of zinc yield growth from polymetallic tailings of the mining industry. In this regard, the purpose of this study was to improve the modeling of metal leaching processes using mechanical activation by improving the compositions of the filling mixtures. The methodology of the work included several comprehensive studies: the mechanical activation of tailings during zinc leaching from pulp in the DESI-11 disintegrator; the activation of enrichment tailings and the formation of a filling mass with different parameters of the component composition; the curing of cubic samples and their testing on the IP-1250 press. The Vi Improved text editor was used to prepare the algorithms for deterministic methods of three-dimensional interpolation in the Python language. The experimental results were graphically displayed using Gnuplot. The study of the agitation leaching of the waste obtained from the Sadonskiy mining district results in the fact that the NaCl mass concentration decreased from 13 to 1% and the H2SO4 concentration stabilization within 0.5 to 0.6% led to a 3-time increase in the zinc yield from the pulp, according to the polynomial law (from 28 to 91%). The obtained results expand the idea of the mechanism of the strength gain by the filling mass under mechanical activation on the components of the filling mixture, as well as changes in the efficiency of zinc leaching at different ratios of two types of lixiviants (sulphuric acid and sodium chloride) in the leaching solution.";"[Golik, Vladimir I.; Klyuev, Roman V.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Tech & Technol Min & Oil & Gas Prod, 38,B Semenovskaya St, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Martyushev, Nikita V.; Mengxu, Qi] Tomsk Polytech Univ, Dept Mat Sci, 30,Lenin Ave, Tomsk 634050, Russia; [Brigida, Vladimir] Russian Acad Sci, Fed Res Ctr Subtrop Sci Ctr, 2 28,Yana Fabritsiusa St, Soci 354002, Russia; [Brigida, Vladimir] RUDN Univ, PeoplesFriendship Univ Russia, Dept Biomed Vet & Ecol Direct, 6,Miklukho Maklaya St, Moscow 117198, Russia; [Efremenkov, Egor A.; Sorokova, Svetlana N.] Tomsk Polytech Univ, Dept Mech Engn, 30,Lenin Ave, Tomsk 634050, Russia";"Moscow Polytechnic University; Tomsk Polytechnic University; Russian Academy of Sciences; Peoples Friendship University of Russia; Tomsk Polytechnic University";Martyushev, NV (автор для корреспонденции), Tomsk Polytech Univ, Dept Mat Sci, 30,Lenin Ave, Tomsk 634050, Russia.;"v.i.golik@mail.ru; kluev-roman@rambler.ru; martjushev@tpu.ru; 1z011@inbox.ru; egorefr@tpu.ru; s_sorokova@tpu.ru; mensyuy1@tpu.ru";"Brigida, Vladimir/G-6933-2018; Mengxu, Qi/JKI-9975-2023; Klyuev, Roman Vladimirovich/AAX-6549-2021; Efremenkov, Egor Alekseevich/F-1420-2014; Klyuev, Roman/J-8000-2014; Golik, Vladimir Ivanovich/K-3731-2018; Martyushev, Nikita/AAO-2653-2020";"Brigida, Vladimir/0000-0002-9421-5613; Klyuev, Roman Vladimirovich/0000-0003-3777-7203; Efremenkov, Egor Alekseevich/0000-0001-6617-9152; Klyuev, Roman/0000-0003-3777-7203; Martyushev, Nikita/0000-0003-0620-9561";;;;;49;21;21;6;8;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;1996-1944;;MATERIALS;Materials;JAN;2023;16;2;;;;;;;726;10.3390/ma16020726;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ma16020726;;;15;"Chemistry, Physical; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering; Physics, Applied; Physics, Condensed Matter";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Chemistry; Materials Science; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering; Physics";8Q5OM;36676461;Green Published, gold;;;2023-12-25;WOS:000927256200001;View Full Record in Web of Science

The relevance of the stated problem is due to the growing interest in the history of Russian conservative journalism and its role in the life of Russia in the second half of the 19th century. The novelty of the study consists in the introduction into scholarly discourse of little-studied material, in particular, the letters of Boleslav Markevich and Pobedonostsev. The analysis of the relations between the high-ranking official and the authoritative journalist in the years preceding the culminating period of their political careers shows the characteristic features of the political life of Russia in the 1870s, to determine the role of personal ties between representatives of the bureaucratic elite and the leaders of domestic journalism. On the basis of poorly studied archival materials, diary entries, letters and memoirs of contemporaries, the authors consider forms of interaction between Pobedonostsev and Katkov. The authors prove that, during this period, Pobedonostsev did not provide Katkov and his newspaper with significant assistance: he did not take part in finding contacts necessary for the journalist in the entourage of Alexander II and in the government, did not try to influence the decisions of the highest censorship bodies, did not provide information support, etc. On the contrary, Pobedonostsev himself needed Katkov's support during these years and could only provide moral assistance to the journalist, expressing in personal correspondence his solidarity and sympathy with his speeches in the newspaper Moskovskie Vedomosti. Katkov opposed his decisive actions, assertiveness, purposefulness, and desire to achieve the result he needed in everything to Pobedonostsev's pedantry, habit of formalism, standard, and desire to avoid significant changes. As a result, despite the closeness of views that evolved to conservatism during this period and frankness in expressing their dissatisfaction with the government course to each other, Pobedonostsev and Katkov had growing internal contradictions and misunderstandings, which eventually led to disunity between them in the 1880s, when they both began to play major roles in the entourage of Emperor Alexander III. The authors conclude that the union of Pobedonostsev and Katkov, which seemed strong and indestructible to many contemporaries, became fragile and unstable back in the 1870s, and did not contribute to the formation of a unified and clear program of Russian conservatives.;"[Perevalova, Elena, V; Perevalov, Valery V.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Journalism & Mass Commun, Moscow, Russia";Moscow Polytechnic University;Perevalova, EV (автор для корреспонденции), Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Journalism & Mass Commun, Moscow, Russia.;"helenpv@yandex.ru; val-perevalov@yandex.ru";;;;;;;33;0;0;0;0;TOMSK STATE UNIV;TOMSK;LENIN AVE, 36, TOMSK, 634050, RUSSIA;1561-7793;1561-803X;;TOMSK STATE UNIV J;Tomsk State Univ.

It incorporates crystallization processes, enantiotropic polymorphic transitions, and cooling with consideration for heat-removal conditions variable over the surface of the grains, shrinkage phenomena, kinetic parameters, and variable model coefficients and, in addition, not only radial, but also longitudinal heat-transfer and interface dynamics, in contrast to our earlier proposed models. The iterative locally one-dimensional algorithm of numerical solution with mobile interface nodes on a six-point implicit nonlinear stable conservative finite-difference scheme is improved. The adequacy of this model to the character of the real process is confirmed by high-speed thermography. As a scientific and practical illustration for the proposed method, computational experiments and performance analysis are carried out for strip, roller, and disc crystallizers as applied to a number of industrial products, such as nitrogen-containing mineral fertilizers, alkalies, sulfur, potassium nitrate, acetonanyl, phosphorus furnace slags, and others. The proposed mathematical description can be applied to both classic phase transitions (crystallization-melting, enantiotropic polymorphic transitions) and to some processes which are formally identical to them, such as sol-gel transitions within the framework of formal similarity between the processes with the structural reengagement of an initial system.;"[Taran, Yu.

The analysis of weld geometry shows that the heat-affected zone (HAZ) width, nugget diameter, and nugget area tend to decrease rapidly, while the nugget height tends to increase with the weld repetitions until the welding heat input becomes too small to form an effective nugget. The maximum displacement and failure energy of the welded joints show a decreasing trend during the welding electrode failure process, while the peak load increases slightly until the 88th weld and then decreases. The cavities and pores in the nugget mainly appear after the 176th spot weld. The electrode diameter increases during welding. The reason for the increase in electrode diameter may be that the contact area between the electrode and the BH 220 steel sheets becomes smaller in the welding process, which causes the continuous sticking phenomenon between the electrode and the BH 220 steel sheets. In the absence of alloying, the edge of the electrode is geometrically deformed, while Cu-Zn-Fe alloying occurs in the area in contact with the BH 220 steel sheet.;"[Zhao, Dawei; Vdonin, Nikita; Bezgans, Yuriy] South Ural State Univ, Inst Engn & Technol, Dept Welding Engn, Chelyabinsk 454080, Russia; [Radionova, Lyudmila] Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Met, Bolshaya Semyonovskaya St 38, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Glebov, Lev] South Ural State Univ, Inst Engn & Technol, Dept Met Forming, Chelyabinsk 454080, Russia";"South Ural State University; Moscow Polytechnic University; South Ural State University";Zhao, DW (автор для корреспонденции), South Ural State Univ, Inst Engn & Technol, Dept Welding Engn, Chelyabinsk 454080, Russia.;chzhaod@susu.ru;"Radionova, Liudmila V./K-2444-2015; Glebov, Lev/JLL-8177-2023; Zhao, Dawei/AAU-9928-2020";"Radionova, Liudmila V./0000-0001-9587-2925; Zhao, Dawei/0000-0002-3865-2958";Russian Science Foundation [22-29-20095];Russian Science Foundation(Russian Science Foundation (RSF));This investigation is supported by the Russian Science Foundation (22-29-20095).;;34;2;2;3;4;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;2073-4352;;CRYSTALS;Crystals;JAN;2023;13;1;;;;;;;39;10.3390/cryst13010039;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/cryst13010039;;;17;"Crystallography; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Crystallography; Materials Science";7Y5UP;;Green Submitted, gold;;;2023-12-25;WOS:000914944400001;View Full Record in Web of Science

The main objectives of the study are to study the problems of children's health, to determine the factors that improve it, to identify the role of physical culture for the health and development of schoolchildren. The study was conducted in a secondary school in Russia, it was attended by ninth graders aged 15-16 years in the number of 141 schoolchildren. The main research method was the Turns on the gym bench, which determines the level of vestibular stability development of schoolchildren. The test was used before and after the physical education lesson 1 time per month for 5 months. Children who did not engage in physical education in the lesson were not able to significantly improve their performance in the test, which indicates a possible adaptation to the test after its first performance before the lesson. Children who were engaged in physical exercises were able to significantly increase the test results. The results obtained determine the effectiveness of the influence of a physical education lesson at school on the indicators of children's vestibular stability. This study will serve as an additional motivation for children to engage in physical culture, since the impact of physical exercises has a positive effect not only on the development of physical qualities, but also on the vestibular stability of schoolchildren.;"[Polevoy, Georgiy] Moscow Polytech Univ, Moscow, Russia; [Polevoy, Georgiy] Vyatka State Univ, Kirov, Russia";"Moscow Polytechnic University; Vyatka State University";"Polevoy, G (автор для корреспонденции), Moscow Polytech Univ, Moscow, Russia.;Polevoy, G (автор для корреспонденции), Vyatka State Univ, Kirov, Russia.";;;;;;;;40;0;0;0;1;INT JOURNAL LIFESCIENCE & PHARMA RESEARCH;TAMILNADU;PLOT NO 10, 2 MAIN RD, RENGA NAGAR NEAR TO OLD ALPHA SCH, SATHANOOR MAIN RD, TIRUCHIRAPALLI, TAMILNADU, INDIA;2250-0480;;;INT J LIFE SCI PHARM;Int.

The activating agent was applied by two methods: impregnation and subsequent autoclave treatment. When the powder was activated by the impregnation method, the crystal sizes remained at the initial level of 0.17-0.19 mu m. After the autoclave treatment, the crystal sizes increased to 0.31-0.53 mu m. Samples of cold sintering ZnO with relative density up to 0.96 and average grain sizes 0.29-0.86 mu m were obtained. ZnO powders and ceramic samples were analyzed using SEM, TGA/DSC, and XRD to reveal the effect of the powder activation method and cold sintering conditions on the material microstructure. The effect of ammonium chloride concentration on grain growth and microstructure of ceramic samples is shown.

In cold sintering of the autoclave activated powder, the effect of reducing the average grain size was observed.

The individual effect of the welding variables (welding speed, welding current, and wire feed speed) on the geometries of the weld bead and its tensile properties was explored. The characteristics of the microstructure and macrostructure with various welding technological parameters were also investigated. It is indicated that all the selected welding process parameters significantly affect the welding microstructural and macrostructural features of the welded joints as well as their tensile properties. The results imply that no major defects were observed based on the macrostructure examination. The fusion zone (FZ) changes ferrite and pearlite morphology, relying upon the cooling speed and duration time. The FZ exhibits acicular ferrite, Widmanstatten ferrite, and grain boundary ferrite, resulting in its inferior hardness to that of the coarse grain heat-affected zone (CGHAZ) and weld interface (WI). The adjustment of the welding process parameters bringing about the reduction of the welding heat input contributes to the production of acicular ferrite. The hardness of the weld metal steadily decreases from the heat-affected zone (HAZ) to the base metal (BM). The average tensile strength of the weld metal is 596 MPa, which is comparable to that of the BM. The fracture location is in BM, and the fracture behavior retains ductility. After that, models computing the correlations between welding parameters and welding quality indexes (failure energy of the welded joints, depth of the penetration and bottom reinforcement, and standard derivation of the failure energy) were established and analyzed. The optimal welding parameters were figured out using the desirability approach.;"[Zhao, Dawei; Bezgans, Yuriy; Vdonin, Nikita] South Ural State Univ, Inst Engn & Technol, Dept Welding Engn, Chelyabinsk 454080, Russia; [Radionova, Lyudmila] Moscow Polytech Univ, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Glebov, Lev; Bykov, Vitaly] South Ural State Univ, Inst Engn & Technol, Dept Met Forming, Chelyabinsk 454080, Russia";"South Ural State University; Moscow Polytechnic University; South Ural State University";Zhao, DW (автор для корреспонденции), South Ural State Univ, Inst Engn & Technol, Dept Welding Engn, Chelyabinsk 454080, Russia.;zhaodawei0322@xy.hfut.edu.cn;"Radionova, Liudmila V./K-2444-2015; Zhao, Dawei/AAU-9928-2020; Glebov, Lev/JLL-8177-2023";"Radionova, Liudmila V./0000-0001-9587-2925; Zhao, Dawei/0000-0002-3865-2958;";;;;;28;1;1;0;2;SPRINGER LONDON LTD;LONDON;236 GRAYS INN RD, 6TH FLOOR, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND;0268-3768;1433-3015;;INT J ADV MANUF TECH;Int.

The relationships among macrostructure, microstructure, mechanical properties, and failure modes of welded joints of HSLA 420 steel were studied. An optical microscope was employed to describe the microstructure, macrostructure, and geometry of the welds, while their mechanical properties and failure modes were characterized via tensile shear tests. It turns out to be that the weld nugget mainly contains lath martensite. The results of the microhardness test show that the microhardness of the fusion zone (FZ) is superior to those of the heat-affected zone (HAZ) and base metal (BM). The increase in heat input brings about a decrease in FZ martensite hardness, but the hardness distribution is more uniform. The grain size of the FZ is 38 mu m, 51 mu m, and 62 mu m when the welding time is at the levels of 11 cycles, 15 cycles, and 19 cycles, while its values increased by about 58% as the welding current increases from 7.2 to 9.6 kA. As the welding time increases, the differences between the maximum hardness and minimum hardness decrease from 74 to 54 HV. In the tensile shear test, interfacial fracture and pullout fracture were observed, followed by BM sheet tearing. Evidently, the weld nugget with the size of 4t(0.5) (t = sheet thickness) will not bring about pullout fracture. Furthermore, existing standards for determining the acceptable load capacity of welded joints cannot guarantee good welding quality. Finally, moderate welding current (from 8.4 to 9 kA) and long welding time (above 15 cycles) should be used to obtain the welded joints with sufficiently large FZs which present good mechanical properties in the tensile shear test.;"[Zhao, Dawei; Vdonin, Nikita; Bezgans, Yuriy] South Ural State Univ, Dept Welding Engn, Chelyabinsk 454080, Russia; [Radionova, Lyudmila] Moscow Polytech Univ, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Bykov, Vitaly; Glebov, Lev] South Ural State Univ, Dept Met Forming, Chelyabinsk 454080, Russia";"South Ural State University; Moscow Polytechnic University; South Ural State University";Zhao, DW (автор для корреспонденции), South Ural State Univ, Dept Welding Engn, Chelyabinsk 454080, Russia.;zhaodawei0322@xy.hfut.edu.cn;"Zhao, Dawei/AAU-9928-2020; Radionova, Liudmila V./K-2444-2015; Glebov, Lev/JLL-8177-2023";"Zhao, Dawei/0000-0002-3865-2958; Radionova, Liudmila V./0000-0001-9587-2925;";Russian Science Foundation [22-29-20095];Russian Science Foundation(Russian Science Foundation (RSF));The authors are thankful for the financial support offered by the Russian Science Foundation (22-29-20095).;;43;2;2;2;3;SPRINGER LONDON LTD;LONDON;236 GRAYS INN RD, 6TH FLOOR, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND;0268-3768;1433-3015;;INT J ADV MANUF TECH;Int.

The products obtained are carbon black (pyrolytic carbon), oils, liquid fuels (gasoline, diesel fuel, and fuel oil), metal cord, and heating oil. The yield and composition of the main pyrolytic products are determined. The production of fuel granules by pressing carbon black and other plant wastes, as well as a combustion accelerator (ammonium nitrate), is assessed. In addition, adsorbent production by creating tablets from carbon black and heat-treated shungite is considered. The sorptional capacity of such tablets is determined. Formulas for the cleavage strength and density of the pressed material are obtained on the basis of static experiment design. Nomograms are obtained for determining the structure and deformational characteristics of the fuel granules and adsorbent, with variation in the pressing parameters. A production line for fuel granules is developed on the basis of the compaction of carbon black and other plant wastes, so as to obtain the product in plate or briquet form.;"[Nazarov, V.

However, its fabrication requires high -temperature treatment at-2000 - 2100 degrees C. In this study, we developed an approach based on low-temperature reactive spark plasma sintering to produce dense SiC-based ceramics with superior mechanical properties. It was found that an SPS temperature of 1600 degrees C and introduction of 10 - 15 wt% of mechanically activated non-oxide Ti-Si-C additive is required to manufacture ceramics with a theoretical density of higher than 90%. Nonetheless, employing 5 - 15 wt% of the additive mixture and an SPS temperature of 1700 degrees C, the maximum density of -98% was achieved. The controlled formation and decomposition of the in-situ Ti3SiC2 MAX phase enables the fabrication of the engineering ceramics with enhanced compressive strength (550 MPa), elastic modulus (485 GPa), and microhardness (32 GPa), which are comparable to the best-reported SiC ceramics. The study has a significant potential for practical application in the production of advanced SiC-based ceramics for various purposes and could be used for further understanding and development of the high-temperature sintering methods.;"[Podbolotov, Kirill] Natl Acad Sci Belarussian, Phys Tech Inst, Minsk 220141, BELARUS; [Podbolotov, Kirill; Moskovskikh, Dmitry; Abedi, Mohammad; Suvorova, Veronika; Nepapushev, Andrey] Natl Univ Sci & Technol MISiS, Moscow 119049, Russia; [Moskovskikh, Dmitry] Moscow Polytech Univ, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Ostrikov, Kostya Ken] Queensland Univ Technol, Ctr Mat Sci, Sch Chem & Phys, Brisbane 4000, Australia; [Khort, Alexander] KTH Royal Inst Technol, SE-10044 Stockholm, Sweden; [Podbolotov, Kirill] Natl Acad Sci Belarussian, Phys Tech Inst, Minsk 220141, BELARUS";"National Academy of Sciences of Belarus (NASB); Physical & Technical Institute of the National Academy of Sciences of Belarus; National University of Science & Technology (MISIS); Moscow Polytechnic University; Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Royal Institute of Technology; National Academy of Sciences of Belarus (NASB); Physical & Technical Institute of the National Academy of Sciences of Belarus";"Podbolotov, K (автор для корреспонденции), Natl Acad Sci Belarussian, Phys Tech Inst, Minsk 220141, BELARUS.;Podbolotov, K; Moskovskikh, D (автор для корреспонденции), Natl Univ Sci & Technol MISiS, Moscow 119049, Russia.;Khort, A (автор для корреспонденции), KTH Royal Inst Technol, SE-10044 Stockholm, Sweden.;Podbolotov, K (автор для корреспонденции), Natl Acad Sci Belarussian, Phys Tech Inst, Minsk 220141, BELARUS.";"k.podbolotov@yahoo.com; dmitry.moskovskikh@gmail.com; khort@kth.se";"Suvorova (Buinevich), Veronika/AAQ-3343-2020; Khort, Alexander/D-8076-2017; Podbolotov, Kirill/F-2733-2019; Ostrikov, Kostya/B-2997-2008";"Suvorova (Buinevich), Veronika/0000-0002-0335-9153; Khort, Alexander/0000-0002-3561-5625; Podbolotov, Kirill/0000-0001-9323-2481;";;;;;60;2;2;7;30;ELSEVIER SCI LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND;0955-2219;1873-619X;;J EUR CERAM SOC;J.

The development of adaptation and restructuring of motor actions of schoolchildren using a coordination ladder in physical education lessons. The study was conducted based on the ordinary school of the city of Kirov in Russia. The study involved children aged 8-9 years. The children in the control group studied according to the standard program, and the children from the control group additionally performed exercises on the coordination ladder. The students attended physical education classes 2 times a week, each lesson lasted 40 minutes. A total of 72 lessons were in each group. The ability to adapt and rebuild motor actions was determined using the Game of Blunders test. Statistical processing was carried out with the T-Student program. After the end of the pedagogical experiment, the indicators of children in the control group improved by 11.9% (p>0.05), the positive dynamics can be explained by a natural increase in coordination abilities at the age of 8-9 years and the effectiveness of using the standard physical education program in Russian schools. The indicators of children in the experimental group improved by 52.4% (p<0.05). Such results can be explained by the effectiveness of the implementation of a set of exercises using a coordination ladder in physical education lessons. The indicators of adapt and rebuild motor actions will significantly improve if children aged 8-9 perform a set of physical exercises on the coordination ladder during physical education lessons.;"[Polevoy, Georgiy Georgievich] Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Phys Educ, Moscow, Russia; [Polevoy, Georgiy Georgievich] Vyatka State Univ, Dept Phys Educ, Kirov, Russia";"Moscow Polytechnic University; Vyatka State University";Polevoy, GG (автор для корреспонденции), Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Phys Educ, Moscow, Russia.;g.g.polevoy@gmail.com;;;;;;;21;0;0;1;6;ARCHIVES GLOBAL PROFESSIONALS;KARACHI;ARCHIVES GLOBAL PROFESSIONALS, KARACHI, PAKISTAN;2320-5210;2045-080X;;ARCH PHARM PRACT;Arch.

Blp was established to possess a folding characteristic of the M23 protease family. The groove of the Blp active site, as compared with that of the LasA structural homologue from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, was found to have amino acid differences. Biochemical analysis revealed no differences in the optimal reaction conditions for manifesting Blp and LasA bacteriolytic activities. At the same time, Blp had a broader range of action against living and autoclaved target cells.

Such a label can be read by standard hardware/software and/or software methods. The formation of a marker based on the image histogram is considered. Due to the redistribution of brightness in a limited tonal range, the histogram section takes the form of a bar code. Due to the visual redundancy of the images, the changes made are invisible when viewing the images. The label can be introduced into the color channel of the image or into the selected spatial region of the channel, which makes it impossible to determine its presence by analyzing the brightness distribution of the image as a whole. The proposed method is sensitive to image transformations and corrections, which allows using it to confirm the originality of the image.;"[Pukhova, E. A.; Vereshchagin, V.

Modern impainting methods of reconstruction drawing use neural networks. However, these approaches are plagued with disadvantages that prevent these algorithms from being used in practical applications of computer vision. The authors have proposed in their recent paper an impainting method based on a non-local mean (NLM) filter that outperforms other conventional image processing methods in terms of peak signal-to-noise ration (PSNR). However, this algorithm may create artifacts at the boundaries of the rendering zones that distort visual perception. In this article, we propose to draw not the image, but the gradients of the image restored and only then restore the image itself, maintaining in this way connectivity at the border of the rendering areas. This method eliminates most of the artifacts that arise when using the previously proposed method, and also surpasses it in terms of the recovery accuracy assessed using the PSNR criterion.;"[Karnaukhov, V.

Aluminum nitride particles were obtained through self-propagating high-temperature synthesis and mechanically mixed with aluminum matrix powder. Optimization of the LPBF process parameters resulted in synthesized material free of pores and other defects. Optical microscopy analysis of etched cross-section and more detailed EBSD analysis revealed regions with relatively coarse grains at melting pool boundaries and fine grains in the melt pool core and near the AlN particles. Moreover, a pronounced orientation of fine elongated matrix grains towards the center of the ceramic particle was obtained. The such formed microstructure is attributed to directional heat sink during crystallization due to the higher thermal conductivity of aluminum nitride compared to the AlSi10Mg matrix. On the contrary, poor wettability of AlN by melt partly prevented the formation of such features, thus a combination of these factors determines the final microstructure of the interface in the resulting material.;"[Pelevin, Ivan A.; Ozherelkov, Dmitriy Yu.; Nalivaiko, Anton Yu.; Chernyshikhin, Stanislav V.; Zotov, Boris O.; Korshunov, Andrey V.; Gromov, Alexander A.] Natl Univ Sci & Technol MISIS, Catalysis Lab, Leninsky Ave 4, Moscow 119049, Russia; [Nalivaiko, Anton Yu.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Univ Adm, Bolshaya Semyonovskaya 38, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Bodyakova, Anna I.] Belgorod State Univ, Lab Mech Properties Nanoscale Mat & Superalloys, 85 Pobedy St, Belgorod 308015, Russia; [Chernyshikhin, Stanislav V.] Skolkovo Inst Sci & Technol, Ctr Design Mfg & Mat, Moscow 121205, Russia; [Korshunov, Andrey V.] Moscow State Univ Civil Engn, Dept Bldg Mat, 26,Yaroslavskoye Shosse, Moscow 129337, Russia";"National University of Science & Technology (MISIS); Moscow Polytechnic University; Belgorod State University; Skolkovo Institute of Science & Technology; Moscow State University of Civil Engineering";Pelevin, IA (автор для корреспонденции), Natl Univ Sci & Technol MISIS, Catalysis Lab, Leninsky Ave 4, Moscow 119049, Russia.;i.pelevin@misis.ru;"Korshunov, Andrey V./AAD-4752-2022; Bodyakova (Morozova), Anna/GPX-6740-2022; Gromov, Alexander/N-1673-2014; Ozherelkov, Dmitriy/G-6720-2014";"Korshunov, Andrey V./0000-0002-7585-0953; Bodyakova (Morozova), Anna/0000-0002-9378-0338; Gromov, Alexander/0000-0002-2641-2607; Ozherelkov, Dmitriy/0000-0003-1553-4526; Chernyshikhin, Stanislav/0000-0001-7419-9604; Zotov, Boris/0009-0001-8801-6044; Pelevin, Ivan/0000-0003-1592-3062";"Russian Science Foundation; [19-79-30025]; [21-79-10240]";"Russian Science Foundation(Russian Science Foundation (RSF)); ;";This study was performed with the financial support of the Russian Science Foundation, projects # 19-79-30025 and # 21-79-10240.;;64;1;1;16;24;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;2075-4701;;METALS-BASEL;Metals;DEC;2022;12;12;;;;;;;2152;10.3390/met12122152;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/met12122152;;;13;"Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Materials Science; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering";7J3LC;;gold, Green Published;;;2023-12-25;WOS:000904483200001;View Full Record in Web of Science

The children were differentiated into a control group (they were engaged in a standard program. The experimental group studied according to the standard program, but after the warm-up they performed a set of exercises on the gymnastic stick. The children were engaged in physical education for 40 minutes 2 times a week. The ability to spatial orientation was determined using the Running to Numbers test. The Student's T-test was used in statistical processing. After the end of the pedagogical experiment, the indicators of children in the control group improved by 7.9% (p>0.05), the positive dynamics can be explained by a natural increase in coordination abilities at the age of 8-9 years and the effectiveness of using the standard physical education program in Russian schools.

However, there have not yet been any systematic studies or elaboration of the influence of different grid powers on current and voltage THD using PPWM. Therefore, this article focuses on a comparative analysis of current and voltage THD in a system with a three-phase, three-level active front-end (AFE) at different grid powers by applying PPWM. A six-pulse electric drive power circuit and one laboratory measurement platform were designed and set up to achieve the above goals. The comparative results were calculated up to the 50th (THD50) and 100th (THD100) harmonics against the frequency of the PPWM, ranging between 150 Hz and 750 Hz. The grid power and AFE power ratio was between 30 and 230 under three different AFE-consumed currents. The experimental results were analyzed and compared, and they demonstrated for the first time how the grid power and AFE power ratio with different PPWM patterns can influence current and voltage THD. The research results suggest that it is necessary to review the existing calculation methods for current and voltage THD using modern electric power quality standards. The results presented in this article also provide a reference point for researchers and engineers when considering the electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) of nonlinear consumers in the design of similar circuits.;"[Maklakov, Alexander S.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Project Act Ctr, Sci Act Sect, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Jing, Tao] China Jiliang Univ, Sch Mech & Elect Engn, Hangzhou 310018, Peoples R China; [Nikolaev, Alexander A.] Nosov Magnitogorsk State Tech Univ, Dept Automated Elect Drives & Mechatron, Magnitogorsk 455000, Russia";"Moscow Polytechnic University; China Jiliang University; Nosov Magnitogorsk State Technical University";Maklakov, AS (автор для корреспонденции), Moscow Polytech Univ, Project Act Ctr, Sci Act Sect, Moscow 107023, Russia.;alexandr.maklakov.ru@ieee.org;"Maklakov, Aleksandr S/GSN-5269-2022; Nikolaev, Alexander/C-6568-2014";"Maklakov, Aleksandr S/0000-0001-7950-708X; Nikolaev, Alexander/0000-0001-5014-4852";Moscow Polytechnic University (Pyotr Kapitsa grant);Moscow Polytechnic University (Pyotr Kapitsa grant);This study was financially supported by the Moscow Polytechnic University (Pyotr Kapitsa grant).;;33;1;1;0;5;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;2075-1702;;MACHINES;Machines;DEC;2022;10;12;;;;;;;1139;10.3390/machines10121139;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/machines10121139;;;16;"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Engineering, Mechanical";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Engineering;7G7RF;;gold;;;2023-12-25;WOS:000902715700001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Its implementation largely depends on the means and methods of planning electricity production. Forecasting is one of the planning tools since the availability of an accurate forecast is a mechanism for increasing the validity of management decisions. This study provides an overview of the methods used to predict electricity supply requirements to different objects. The methods have been reviewed analytically, taking into account the forecast classification according to the anticipation period. In this way, the methods used in operative, short-term, medium-term, and long-term forecasting have been considered. Both classical and modern forecasting methods have been identified when forecasting electric energy consumption. Classical forecasting methods are based on the theory of regression and statistical analysis (regression, autoregressive models); probabilistic forecasting methods and modern forecasting methods use classical and deep-machine-learning algorithms, rank analysis methodology, fuzzy set theory, singular spectral analysis, wavelet transformations, Gray models, etc. Due to the need to take into account the specifics of each subject area characterizing an energy facility to obtain reliable forecast results, power consumption modeling remains an urgent task despite a wide variety of other methods. The review was conducted with an assessment of the methods according to the following criteria: labor intensity, requirements for the initial data set, scope of application, accuracy of the forecasting method, the possibility of application for other forecasting horizons. The above classification of methods according to the anticipation period allows highlights the fact that when predicting power consumption for different time intervals, the same methods are often used. Therefore, it is worth emphasizing the importance of classifying the forecast over the forecasting horizon not to differentiate the methods used to predict electricity consumption for each period but to consider the specifics of each type of forecasting (operative, short-term, medium-term, long-term).";"[Klyuev, Roman V.

During offset printing, composites come into contact with inks and washing solutions, the components of which penetrate the material and cause the polymers to swell. This process degrades the print quality, and for this reason the study of its features is relevant. The prerequisites for this work are the study of the fundamental laws of diffusion and sorption of liquids by polymers with different micro- and macro-structures in different physical states and in different forms (e.g., films, sheets, fibers and fabrics). The combination of polymer materials in the composition of multi-structural fabric blankets makes it possible to obtain materials with unique mechanical properties and high resistance to liquid penetrating media and to use them in high-tech processes of multi-color printing with high resolution and color rendering. This article reports for the first time the kinetics and thermodynamics results obtained from the swelling of multi-structural polymeric blankets in solvents used in printing, and the effect of sorption of different polar liquids on the viscoelastic strain under compression during the operation of the damping systems of printing machines. Using mathematical models of activated liquid diffusion in polymers and deformation of a viscoelastic body, the swelling rate constants, solvent diffusion coefficients (the kinetic characteristics of the swelling process) and Flory-Huggins parameters (the thermodynamic characteristics of the interaction of the solvent with the composite) for composite-solvent systems with several chemical composition variants were determined. The elastic modulus and the viscosity coefficient of the composite under liquid saturation were calculated based on the experimental cyclic compression data. The range of change in the compression and restoration times of the polymeric blankets (0.09 s divided by 0.78 s) was determined. It was shown that the composite swelled to a limited extent in all the studied liquids. All solvents used were thermodynamically poor (chi > 0.5). It has been established that rubber-fabric blankets coated with nitrile rubber are the least resistant to the action of dichloroethane, and that blankets with layers of polyolefins are not resistant to ethyl acetate. Water significantly affects the physicochemical properties of rubber-fabric blankets with a large proportion of cotton fabric layers. The data obtained can serve as a basis for optimizing the compositions of inks and cleaning solutions, as well as a theoretical basis for the thermodynamics of composite-solvent systems.;"[Kondratov, Alexander; Yamilinets, Stanislav] Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Innovat Mat Print Media Ind, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Konyukhov, Valery] Mendeleev Univ Chem Technol, Dept Phys Chem, Moscow 125047, Russia; [Marchenko, Ekaterina; Baigonakova, Gulsharat] Natl Res Tomsk State Univ, Lab Superelast Biointerfaces, Tomsk 634045, Russia";"Moscow Polytechnic University; Mendeleev University of Chemical Technology of Russia; Tomsk State University";Baigonakova, G (автор для корреспонденции), Natl Res Tomsk State Univ, Lab Superelast Biointerfaces, Tomsk 634045, Russia.;gat27@mail.ru;"Кондратов, Александр/ADR-7029-2022; Yamilinets, Stanislav/GXG-6506-2022; Baigonakova, Gulsharat/M-4267-2018; Marchenko, Ekaterina/E-9914-2017";"Yamilinets, Stanislav/0000-0002-9598-1117; Baigonakova, Gulsharat/0000-0001-9853-2766; Marchenko, Ekaterina/0000-0003-4615-5270";"Tomsk State University Development Program; [Priority-2030]";"Tomsk State University Development Program;";This study was supported by the Tomsk State University Development Program (Priority-2030).;;26;0;0;0;0;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;2073-4360;;POLYMERS-BASEL;Polymers;DEC;2022;14;23;;;;;;;5177;10.3390/polym14235177;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/polym14235177;;;11;Polymer Science;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Polymer Science;6X4FR;36501569;Green Published, gold;;;2023-12-25;WOS:000896371300001;View Full Record in Web of Science

It proves that the main purpose of the Commission for the Exploration of the Current Situation of Agriculture and Agricultural Productivity in Russia was the identification of the degree of agricultural makers' adaptation to new post-reform conditions. The study confirms (based on historiographical materials) that the main document for studying the functioning of the Commission in Ryazan Province is The Reports of Respondents Invited to the Commission. The author comes to a conclusion (based on the materials of the central and local archives) that the post-reform decade became a transition period for the economy of Ryazan Province, when the consistent system of economic organization had not been formed yet and agricultural makers had not been adapted to the new post-reform conditions. The author shows that local commons (high-income landowners and farmers) denoted basic regional economic problems: land scarcity, traditional managing methods and nobility's absenteeism. The commons' opinions were sometimes personal, but they could elucidate the main agrarian problems and find out Ryazan Province's specificity: staged transition of noble lands to the peasants, redistribution of farmlands to the merchants, ground lease as the unreliable way of making profit. The author demonstrates that the task of prime importance in Ryazan Province that had been shown by the Valuev Commission's commons was the formation of the free labor market. The region's peculiarity was peasants' unwillingness to get a job in their region, and the shortage of skilled laborers and the deficiency of regulatory environment made it difficult to apply disciplinary actions. The author also draws attention to Ryazan commons' proposals of their own measures to improve landowners' estates: technical modernization and development of the regional agricultural education. The author concludes that most of the Ryazan commons negatively evaluated the development of landowners' economies in the 1870s. Their point of view reflected not only the local economic targets, but widespread economic woes of the Russian Empire. For the Ryazan commons, the participation in the Commission was an important stage in identifying local economic problems, when the zemstvo council's commons could exchange their ideas and experience from the regional to the all-Russian levels. The Commission for the Exploration of the Current Situation of Agriculture and Agricultural Productivity in Russia paved the way for further transformations in the country.;[Kostyleva, Elena N.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Ryazan Inst, Ryazan, Russia;Moscow Polytechnic University;Kostyleva, EN (автор для корреспонденции), Moscow Polytech Univ, Ryazan Inst, Ryazan, Russia.;lena-kostyleva@yandex.ru;;;;;;;24;0;0;0;0;TOMSK STATE UNIV;TOMSK;LENIN AVE, 36, TOMSK, 634050, RUSSIA;1561-7793;1561-803X;;TOMSK STATE UNIV J;Tomsk State Univ.

Millions of tons of hazardous spent sulfuric acid and lime mud are produced by water treatment facilities every year. Unlike other types of waste, lime mud can sometimes be used for the thermal regeneration of lime. However, this approach requires a high energy consumption and, thus, cannot be considered a sustainable or green process. Compared to the latest research, the method presented here allowed for the production of anhydrite in one step at very low temperatures and in a short time while also bypassing the stage of gypsum phase formation.ResultsCalcium sulfate anhydrite was synthesized from the water treatment waste of lime mud by a low-temperature method at temperatures of 25 and 45 & DEG;C. The resulting samples were composed of anhydrite with different crystal morphologies. This was confirmed by XRD, DTA, SEM, TEM, and thermochemical calculations. Dependences of the influence of the shape of crystals on the main technological properties of anhydrite cement and the influence of additives on the activation of the binding properties were established.ConclusionThe research shows that different types of calcium sulfate anhydrite require different additives and in different amounts. Introducing the optimal composition of additives-activators made it possible to obtain anhydrite cement with a water-anhydrite ratio of 0.25, an onset of setting no earlier than 40 min, an end of setting no later than 12 h, and a strength of 28.8 MPa.

Therefore, it is relevant to study the experience of teaching archaeology in the XIX century. This experience is often undeservedly forgotten. The authors of this article introduce into scientific circulation a new archival document - lectures given by the outstanding Russian archaeologist Count A.S. Uvarov to Grand Dukes Sergei Alexandrovich and Pavel Alexandrovich, use the memories of contemporaries to realize the influence of archaeological education on the life and work of Grand Dukes, on the development of higher education in Russia. The novelty of this work lies in the analysis of lectures to representatives of the House of Romanov and the speech of Count A.S. Uvarov at the III Archaeological Congress in the context of the development of Russian and world archaeological thought at the end of the XIX century. As a result, the authors came to the conclusion that the concept of archaeological education proposed by Count A.S. Uvarov was ahead of its time. It included the theory of archaeology from the definition of this science to the interpretation of its basic concepts, the empirical part based on the latest achievements of world archaeological thought, the idea of protecting ancient monuments, which is reflected in the concept of the State Historical Museum and educational Archaeological Museums, and a number of provisions that archaeologists began to address only in the XXI century.;"[Kokorina, Yulia G.; Rogozhkin, Vasily A.; Khusnutdinova, Lyailya G.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Moscow, Russia; [Zulkarnaeva, Elena Z.] Ufa State Petr Tech Univ, Ufa, Russia";"Moscow Polytechnic University; Ufa State Petroleum Technological University";Kokorina, YG (автор для корреспонденции), Moscow Polytech Univ, Moscow, Russia.;"kokorina@inbox.ru; dmitrow16@yandex.ru; Lavanda-55@mail.ru; zulkarnaeva@mail.ru";"Хуснутдинова, Ляйля/HNS-1919-2023; KOKORINA, Julia Georgievna/C-1481-2018";"Хуснутдинова, Ляйля/0000-0002-0095-1135; Zulkarnaeva, Elena/0000-0002-0527-8533";;;;;49;0;0;0;0;Cherkas Global Univ Press;Washington;1717 N Street NW, Suite 1, Washington, District of Columbia, UNITED STATES;2073-9745;2310-0028;;BYLYE GODY;Bylye Gody;DEC 1;2022;17;4;;;;;1831;1842;;10.13187/bg.2022.4.1831;http://dx.doi.org/10.13187/bg.2022.4.1831;;;12;History;Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI);History;6S6JB;;gold;;;2023-12-25;WOS:000893090300001;View Full Record in Web of Science

It has been established that the introduction of lubricants/binders (zinc stearate, nickel stearate, copper stearate, dextrin) and bronze particles improves the values of bulk density and flowability of the powder mixture, and also significantly increases its compactability by reducing inter-particle friction during compaction. The best compactability was demonstrated by a powder mixture of the following composition: PL8 + 2% Mn + 0.35% C + 1% Ni stearate, while the relative density of such mixture at a compaction pressure of 700 MPa was 7.1 g/cm(3).;"[Eremeeva, Jh.

The purpose of the work is relevant and was to develop a methodology for assessing the compliance of extruded polystyrene foam with environmental requirements. The problem is that the certification of such materials includes an examination of their physical and mechanical properties and does not allow assessment of materials' environmental aspects. A comprehensive approach to assessing the quality of extruded polystyrene foam is proposed, which ensures not only the technical level of material quality, but also compliance with environmental requirements. The research methodology is based on the environmental risks' identification at all stages of production and the determination of products environmental safety criteria. Each criterion is characterized by a set of indicators, among which a representative indicator is determined. A complex indicator is proposed for assessing the environmental safety of the production of extruded foamed polystyrene. The novelty of the work lies in the algorithm for calculating the material environmental friendliness complex criterion. The process model of the extruded polystyrene foam production analyses made it possible to establish representative indicators according to the products' environmental safety criteria. As a result of the analysis, critical operations were identified where environmental risks are likely, and representative indicators' limit values were set in accordance with regulatory documentation. Measures have been developed to minimize the release of harmful substances during each critical operation. To improve environmental management, the system for monitoring and assessing risks in the production of extruded foamed polystyrene has been optimized. As a result, a methodology has been developed for assessing the compliance of the production of extruded polystyrene foam with environmental requirements, which is necessary for product quality certification.;"[Lisienkova, Liubov] Natl Res Univ, Moscow State Univ Civil Engn, Yaroslavskoe Shosse 26, Moscow 129337, Russia; [Nosova, Lyudmila] South Ural State Humanitarian & Pedag Univ, Lenina Ave 69, Chelyabinsk 454080, Russia; [Shindina, Tatiana] Natl Res Univ, Moscow Power Engn Inst, Krasnokazarmennaya 14, Moscow 111250, Russia; [Komarova, Liudmila] Moscow Polytech Univ, BolshayaSemyonovskaya Ulitsa 38, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Baranova, Ekaterina] South Ural State Univ, Natl Res Univ, Zlatoust Branch, Turgenev St, 17, Zlatoust 456207, Russia; [Kozhinov, Dmitry] Moscow State Univ Technol & Management, Ground Shaft St 73, Moscow 109004, Russia";"Moscow State University of Civil Engineering; Moscow Power Engineering Institute; Moscow Polytechnic University; South Ural State University";Lisienkova, L (автор для корреспонденции), Natl Res Univ, Moscow State Univ Civil Engn, Yaroslavskoe Shosse 26, Moscow 129337, Russia.;lisienkovaln@mail.ru;Komarova, Ludmila/O-4188-2015;"Komarova, Ludmila/0000-0003-3005-6411; Kozinov, Dmitrii/0000-0002-7608-5229; Shindina, Tatyana/0000-0003-0716-780X";;;;;39;1;1;0;3;C EJ PUBLISHING GROUP;TEHRAN;DR KAVIANPOUR OFF, 3RD FL CIVIL ENGINEERING FAC, K N TOOSI UNIV TECHNOLOGY, TEHRAN, 00000, IRAN;2676-6957;2476-3055;;CIV ENG J-TEHRAN;Civ.

The composites were prepared in a three-stage process including the mixing of elastomeric compounds via a rubber mixing mill and low-temperature vulcanization by heat pressing. Using dynamical mechanical analysis (DMA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) the effect of the metallic filler on the process of carbonization of the composite elastomeric matrix was studied. The microstructure and gas separation properties of the resulting composites were also studied. The results showed that the filler content increase in the elastomeric matrix leads to a noticeable and gradual decrease in the activation energy of the carbonization process, reduces the temperature of this process, and accelerates the growth of the elastic modulus during carbonization. It was shown that the finely dispersed fiber of the MPC acts as an activation center for the process of thermal-oxidative degradation in the elastomeric matrix accompanying the onset of carbonization. The gas permeability values were found to be relatively low and no visible correlation with the MPC alloy content in the composite membrane was observed.;"[Zadorozhnyy, Mikhail] Moscow Polytech Univ, Ctr Project Act, Bolshaya Semenovskaya St 2, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Zadorozhnyy, Mikhail; Stepashkin, Andrey; Korol, Artem; Zadorozhnyy, Vladislav] Univ Sci & Technol MISIS, Res Ctr Composite Mat, Leninsky Prosp 4, Moscow 119049, Russia; [Savvotin, Ivan; Berdonosova, Elena; Klyamkin, Semen] Lomonosov Moscow State Univ, Dept Chem, Leninskiye Gory 1, Moscow 119991, Russia";"Moscow Polytechnic University; National University of Science & Technology (MISIS); Lomonosov Moscow State University";"Zadorozhnyy, M (автор для корреспонденции), Moscow Polytech Univ, Ctr Project Act, Bolshaya Semenovskaya St 2, Moscow 107023, Russia.;Zadorozhnyy, M; Zadorozhnyy, V (автор для корреспонденции), Univ Sci & Technol MISIS, Res Ctr Composite Mat, Leninsky Prosp 4, Moscow 119049, Russia.";"zadorozhnyy.my@misis.ru; vuz@misis.ru";"; Stepashkin, Andrey/A-8244-2014";"Korol, Artem/0000-0002-9263-1840; Stepashkin, Andrey/0000-0002-0034-7587; Klyamkin, Semen/0000-0001-6009-1045";"Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation [K1-2022-032, AAAA-A16-116053110012-5, 122012400186-9]; Development program of the Interdisciplinary Scientific and Educational School of Lomonosov Moscow State University; Moscow Polytechnic University within the framework of the grant named after Pyotr Kapitsa; Ministry of science and higher education of Russia [0718-2020-0036]";"Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation; Development program of the Interdisciplinary Scientific and Educational School of Lomonosov Moscow State University; Moscow Polytechnic University within the framework of the grant named after Pyotr Kapitsa; Ministry of science and higher education of Russia";This work was supported by the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation in the framework of the federal academic leadership program Priority 2030 under the increase competitiveness program of NUST << MISiS >> (grant number K1-2022-032).

Increasing the throughput is an urgent task due to the planned technical re-equipment and the introduction of new equipment in connection with the development of enterprises. The paper presents an analysis of the operating modes of a number of transformer substations that directly power the electrical equipment of industrial installations, as well as the power lines of these substations. It is proposed to increase the capacity of the electrical network by compensating for the reactive power consumed by electrical equipment of substations, for which it is proposed to use synchronous electric motors used at production facilities as a drive for pumping and compressor units. The paper presents an analysis of the available reactive power of the used synchronous electric motors. The analysis of active power losses arising in synchronous electric motors during reactive power generation has been carried out. It is shown that an increase in the throughput of power lines can be achieved by choosing the optimal mode of operation of synchronous electric motors. It is shown that when choosing the parameters of the optimal operating mode of a synchronous electric motor, which provides an increase in the throughput of the substation power line, it is necessary to be guided by the criterion of minimum active power losses. A mathematical model has been developed for the steady state operation of a substation and a power line, taking into account active power losses in a synchronous electric motor. With the help of the developed model, the optimal value of reactive power was determined, which the synchronous motor of this substation should generate in order to increase the throughput of the power line with a minimum of active power losses using the example of one substation. The calculation of the excitation current of a synchronous motor is presented, at which the required value of the generated reactive power is achieved, which is necessary to select the setting of the automatic excitation control system. The economic effect of optimizing the operating mode of synchronous electric motors is to reduce the cost of paying for electricity, due to a decrease in active power losses in the line.;"[Klyuev, R.

RSPS involves the SPS consolidation process and chemical reactions. SPS parameters such as the heating rate, maximum temperature, and dwell time influence the kinetics of the chemical reaction. To control the sintering process, it is critical to understand the relationship between the SPS parameters and different reaction modes. For a highly reactive Ni-Al system, we directly compare the consolidation kinetics under various SPS conditions. Comparing the RSPS and SPS schemes, we unequivocally conclude that the reactive mode permits an overall higher densification for the considered system. Two RSPS strategies are identified: i) RSPS under self-sustained reaction conditions occurring under a high heating rate and large volume-to-surface ratio, and ii) RSPS under relatively slow reaction rate conditions. The question of which strategy is best is addressed based on an analysis of the microstructures and mechanical properties of the fabricated materials.;"[Abedi, Mohammad; Kuskov, Kirill; Moskovskikh, Dmitry; Zakharova, Elena, V; Belov, Dmitry] Natl Univ Sci & Technol MISIS, Moscow 119049, Russia; [Moskovskikh, Dmitry] Moscow Polytech Univ, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Mukasyan, Alexander] Univ Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA";"National University of Science & Technology (MISIS); Moscow Polytechnic University; University of Notre Dame";"Abedi, M; Kuskov, K (автор для корреспонденции), Natl Univ Sci & Technol MISIS, Moscow 119049, Russia.;Mukasyan, A (автор для корреспонденции), Univ Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.";"abedi@edu.misis.ru; kkuskov@misis.ru; amoukasi@nd.edu";"Abedi, Mohammad/S-8619-2018; Kuskov, Kirill V/G-9632-2015; Kuskov, Kirill V/CAI-8647-2022";"Abedi, Mohammad/0000-0001-9751-5948; Kuskov, Kirill V/0000-0002-9387-0237; Kuskov, Kirill V/0000-0002-9387-0237";;;;;34;7;7;5;15;ELSEVIER SCI LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND;0966-9795;1879-0216;;INTERMETALLICS;Intermetallics;JAN;2023;152;;;;;;;;107750;10.1016/j.intermet.2022.107750;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.intermet.2022.107750;;OCT 2022;10;"Chemistry, Physical; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Chemistry; Materials Science; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering";5Y3QA;;;;;2023-12-25;WOS:000879198400001;View Full Record in Web of Science

The study was conducted from February to May 2021 on the basis of Sambo-70 (Moscow) and SKP SK KBR (Nalchik) institutions with the participation of 90 wrestlers aged 13 to 15. The assessment of the individual asymmetry profile and postural status was carried out on the basis of testing, observation, analysis of the content of training and competitive activities, and stabilometry with subsequent analysis of individual exposure parameters of the general pressure center on statokine-siograms. It is recorded that wrestlers with different individual asymmetry profiles have the ability to maintain a vertical posture. This ability is characterized by a variety of manifestations and is due to the presence of deviations in the state of the musculoskeletal system and the degree of their severity. Specialized asymmetric load provoked minor violations of posture and muscle balance in 31 examined athletes, significant deviations were found in 7 athletes. The results of the analysis of individual parameters of statokinesiograms - the amplitude of oscillations (Ax, Ay), the trajectory and the area of the general pressure center (S-90), the equilibrium index - confirm the assumption about the role of the motor profile in the formation of various disorders. The use of corrective and preventive complexes of exercises in the educational and training process allowed 26 athletes completely and 9 partially to restore the disturbed balance. Athletes with the status of the musculoskeletal system within the normal range performed special complexes to prevent possible deviations. Stabilometry data acted as an extraordinary indicator characterizing the young athletes' body balance and as an informative method for identifying the specificity of the influence of prolonged, accentuated muscular activity on the mechanisms of formation of the motor stereotype and the individual asymmetry profile. Early establishment of abnormal disorders in the state of the musculoskeletal system and prompt preventive measures on their leveling allow restoring the athlete's correctional resource and optimizing the educational and training process and competitive practice.;"[Podlesnykh, Artem A.; Kim, Tatiana K.] Moscow Pedag State Univ, Moscow, Russia; [Kim, Ruslan K.] Palace Creat Children & Youth, Nalchik, Russia; [Zherebkin, Nikolay N.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Moscow, Russia";Moscow Polytechnic University;Podlesnykh, AA (автор для корреспонденции), Moscow Pedag State Univ, Moscow, Russia.;"artem_podlesnykh1@mail.ru; kim.tatiana@mail.ru; ruslankim07@mail.ru; zherebkin_nikolay.mami@mail.ru";Kim, Tatiana/FCG-4342-2022;Kim, Tatiana/0000-0003-2398-958X;;;;;23;0;0;1;2;TOMSK STATE UNIV;TOMSK;LENIN AVE, 36, TOMSK, 634050, RUSSIA;1561-7793;1561-803X;;TOMSK STATE UNIV J;Tomsk State Univ.

It was demonstrated that an essentially fully dense material could be obtained in 15 s. Such short-term treatment typically preserves the nanostructured features of the material. However, investigation revealed a nonuniformity in the microstructure of the alloys obtained under such extreme conditions. To better understand the observed effects, the FSPS process was simulated. It was observed that a rapid change in the applied electrical power resulted in nonuniform distributions of current density and temperature along the body of the consolidated material. Specifically, the current density was higher on the periphery of the sample, and the temperature was higher in the middle. These findings explain the observed structural transformation during FSPS and suggest an optimization strategy to avoid microstructural nonuniformity.;"[Abedi, Mohammad; Asadi, Atefeh; Moskovskikh, Dmitry] Natl Univ Sci & Technol MISiS, Ctr Funct Nanoceram, Leninskiy Prospekt 4, Moscow 119049, Russia; [Sovizi, Saeed] Sharif Univ Technol, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Tehran 111559466, Iran; [Moskovskikh, Dmitry] Moscow Polytech Univ, Res Lab Scanning Probe Microscopy, B Semenovskaya St 38, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Ostrikov, Kostya (Ken)] Queensland Univ Technol, Sch Chem & Phys, Brisbane, Qld 4000, Australia; [Ostrikov, Kostya (Ken)] Queensland Univ Technol, Ctr Mat Sci, Brisbane, Qld 4000, Australia; [Mukasyan, Alexander] Univ Notre Dame, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA";"National University of Science & Technology (MISIS); Sharif University of Technology; Moscow Polytechnic University; Queensland University of Technology (QUT); Queensland University of Technology (QUT); University of Notre Dame";"Abedi, M (автор для корреспонденции), Natl Univ Sci & Technol MISiS, Ctr Funct Nanoceram, Leninskiy Prospekt 4, Moscow 119049, Russia.;Mukasyan, A (автор для корреспонденции), Univ Notre Dame, Dept Chem & Biomol Engn, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.";"abedi@edu.misis.ru; amoukasi@nd.edu";Abedi, Mohammad/S-8619-2018;"Abedi, Mohammad/0000-0001-9751-5948; Sovizi, Saeed/0000-0001-5210-2576; Moskovskikh, Dmitry/0000-0001-5168-4885; Asadi, Atefeh/0000-0003-0510-950X";;;;;60;1;1;3;15;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;1996-1944;;MATERIALS;Materials;OCT;2022;15;20;;;;;;;7366;10.3390/ma15207366;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ma15207366;;;16;"Chemistry, Physical; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering; Physics, Applied; Physics, Condensed Matter";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Chemistry; Materials Science; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering; Physics";5P1QX;36295432;Green Published, gold;;;2023-12-25;WOS:000872935000001;View Full Record in Web of Science

The concept of an autonomous, independent individual is at the heart of modern society, and therefore should be the basis for the professional self-determination concept. The purpose of the paper is to study the influence of the autonomy factor on the choice of professional (career-related) strategy among young people (students). Based on theoretical analysis, the authors have demonstrated the essence of the phenomenon of personal autonomy as a complex feature of the individual, manifesting itself in the ability to determine one's position and behavior, make a conscious choice, and design one's future on one's own, independently from direct external influences, based on reflection of one's own needs, motives, and values. A comparison of the results of the diagnosis of personal autonomy and professional plans, per age intervals, indicates that the features of the professional prospects of students and their planned professional objectives at each age stage are determined by the nature of personal autonomy.

Applying the second pulse current to alter the weld attributes is viewed as an effective way to boost the mechanical attributes of the spot-welded samples. The achievement of the tempering process rests on the accurate control of the welding heat input, which is affected by the parameters of the post-weld welding pulse. The effects of welding time, welding current, and cooling time in the second welding process upon the microstructure and mechanical attributes of HSLA 420 steel were studied in this paper. Mechanical properties were determined via peak load, failure mode, and failure energy following tensile-shear tests conducted. The welding experiments were performed in compliance with the Box-Behnken design (BBD), while the models qualifying the post-welding parameters and three weld attributes (nugget diameter, peak load, and absorbed energy) were founded by the regression methods. The optimal post-welding conditions were figured out by the desirability approach, and they were the welding pulse current of 9 kA, pulse time of 28 cycles, and cooling time of 26 cycles. In addition, the relationship among microstructure, geometries, and mechanical properties was also considered.

Three types of the sample were prepared from a hot-pressed rod of the wrought AA5051 alloy. Two of them were subjected to the plastic deformation at room temperature -the compression between flat dies and the compression with torsion, which allows to initiate the intense shear deformation. Mechanical spectroscopy being highly structure sensitive method was used to study structural transitions in the samples. Strong dependence on the sample pre-history deformation is reported through heating and isothermal tests. In total, the sample sub-jected to compression with torsion demonstrates much higher metastablity and tendency to recrystallization both at heating and isothermal annealing which is the result of higher dislocation density after this deformation scheme.;"[Petrov, P.

J;Perevalova, EV;;;;Perevalova, Elena, V;;;A minister and a journalist: The relationship between Dmitry Tolstoy and Mikhail Katkov;VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA FILOLOGIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY;;;English;Article;;;;;;"Dmitry Tolstoy; Mikhail Katkov; Moskovskiye Vedomosti; reforms; education";;The article examines the relationship between Dmitry Tolstoy, who served as Minister of Public Education (1866-1880) in the government of Alexander II and as Minister of Internal Affairs and Chief of Gendarmes ( 1882-1889) during the reign of Emperor Alexander III, and Mikhail Katkov, an authoritative journalist, editor-publisher of the influential conservative newspaper Moskovskiye Vedomosti. The main thing that united the interests of the high-ranking official and the influential journalist was the reforms in the field of education in the 1870s and 1880s. Both contemporaries and historical researchers evaluated the activities of Tolstoy and Katkov in this area very ambiguously and quite contradictorily. The problem of the study consists in the uncertainty of ideas about the contribution of each of them to the reform of Russian education in this period. On the basis of archival materials, diaries, letters and memoirs of contemporaries, the article considers the nature of the relationship between Tolstoy and Katkov, the degree of their mutual influence, the role of each in transformation of secondary and higher education during this period. The relevance of the stated problem is due to the ongoing reforms of the modern system of Russian education and the growing interest in the history of this issue, as well as the increasing role of the media in covering these processes. The novelty of the research consists in the introduction into scholarly discourse of new, previously unexplored material, in particular, the letters of Dmitry Tolstoy, Mikhail Katkov, Boleslav Markevich, Evgeny Feoktistov, Aleksandr Georgievsky, and others, stored in the archives of the Department of Manuscripts of the Russian State Library. The analysis of correspondence, the study of memoirs and diary entries of contemporaries allow concluding that the leader in this union was Katkov, whose publications not only provided information support for the reforms undertaken by the Minister of Public Education, but in many ways initiated and directed Tolstoy's activities. Having a strong and resolute character, perseverance in achieving the set goals, unshakable confidence in his own rightness, the journalist for many years successfully defended before Tolstoy those measures that he considered right and correct. For his part, Tolstoy, being able, by virtue of his positions, to report almost daily to the emperor, was a kind of a representative of the journalist, first to Alexander II, and then to Alexander III. At the same time, the minister often acted as Katkov's hidden opponent, repeatedly tried to get rid of his dependence on the journalist, to demonstrate independence in decision-making, but, as a rule, the last word was always left to Katkov. The history of the relationship between Tolstoy and Katkov is a very illustrative example of the increasing influence of the press on the power structures of the Russian Empire in the 1860s-1880s.;[Perevalova, Elena, V] Moscow Polytech Univ, Higher Sch Printing & Media Ind, Journalism & Mass Media Dept, Moscow, Russia;Moscow Polytechnic University;Perevalova, EV (автор для корреспонденции), Moscow Polytech Univ, Higher Sch Printing & Media Ind, Journalism & Mass Media Dept, Moscow, Russia.;helenpv@yandex.ru;;;;;;;51;1;1;0;0;TOMSK STATE UNIV;TOMSK;LENIN AVE, 36, TOMSK, 634050, RUSSIA;1998-6645;2310-5046;;VESTN TOMSK U-FILOL;Vestn.

Such alternatives are intended for the reduction in the electricity and heat net costs as well as the expenses for the operation and maintenance of system elements and damage from power outages or deteriorated power quality. A way to reduce electricity and heat costs is the introduction of distributed energy resources capable of operating on both conventional (natural gas) and alternative (solar and wind energy, biomass, etc.) fuels. The problem of reducing electricity and, in some cases, heat costs are solved by applying mathematical optimization techniques adapted to a specific element or system of the industry in question. When it comes to power industry facilities, optimization, as a rule, includes reducing active power losses by controlling the system mode or specific power unit parameters; planning generating equipment operating modes; defining the optimal equipment composition; improving the regime and structural reliability of grids; scheduling preventive maintenance of equipment; searching for effective power unit operating modes. Many of the problems listed are solved using direct enumeration techniques; modern technical tools allow quickly solving such local problems with a large number of source data. However, in the case of integrated control over the power system or its individual elements, optimization techniques are used that allow considering a lot of operating limitations and the target function multicriteriality. This paper provides an analytical review of optimization techniques adapted to solving problems of improving the efficiency of the power facility operating modes. The article is made on the basis of the research conducted by the authors in the area of optimization of operating modes for electric energy systems and grids. The authors drew conclusions on the applicability of mathematical optimization methods in the power energy area.

Non-uniform temperature distribution at the die-work interface results in the breakdown of lubrication film, which increases the heat generation due to increased friction. This work investigates the temperature distribution in the forging of a workpiece with a single asperity using the finite element (FE) simulations. Effects of asperity height in relation to workpiece, friction at die-work interface, percentage reduction and die velocity are studied. During the forging process, the temperature developed at the asperity region rises very rapidly. The asperity attains the maximum temperature after attaining its full height deformation. For the same deformation of workpiece, the temperature at asperity increases with an increase in the asperity height. The temperature at the asperity reduces with an increase in the friction at the die-work interface. The temperature at asperity as well as on the whole workpiece increases with increasing reduction. As heat dissipation from the workpiece surface is more at a relatively lower speed, the maximum temperature developed at asperity is greater at a higher speed. Insight provided by these simulations will assist in understanding the tribology of metal forming.;"[Raj, Amit; Dixit, Uday Shanker] Indian Inst Technol Guwahati, Dept Mech Engn, Gauhati 781039, India; [Petrov, Pavel] Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Mat Forming & Addit Technol, Moscow, Russia";"Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Guwahati; Moscow Polytechnic University";Dixit, US (автор для корреспонденции), Indian Inst Technol Guwahati, Dept Mech Engn, Gauhati 781039, India.;uday@iitg.ac.in;"Raj, Amit/JAC-2259-2023; Petrov, Pavel/ITV-6650-2023; Petrov, Pavel/A-8443-2011";"Raj, Amit/0000-0002-5337-2057; Petrov, Pavel/0000-0001-5541-5690; Petrov, Pavel/0000-0001-5541-5690; Dixit, Uday/0000-0001-7325-1618";"Russian Foundation for Basic Research [19-58-45020]; Department of Science and Technology, New Delhi [INT/RUS/RFBR/388]";"Russian Foundation for Basic Research(Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR)Spanish Government); Department of Science and Technology, New Delhi(Department of Science & Technology (India))";"The work was supported by the Russian Foundation for Basic Research [19-58-45020]; Department of Science and Technology, New Delhi [INT/RUS/RFBR/388]";;29;0;0;0;1;TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;2374-068X;2374-0698;;ADV MATER PROCESS TE;Adv.

Considering the rheological characteristics of copper M0 and the lubrication conditions of the rolls, a rational technology was designed for the rolling bands with a cross section of 0.55 x 20 mm from the semi-finished rolled products measuring 0.7 x 20 x 2000 mm. It was observed that using the roll lubrication with the industrial oil I20 or I40 at the 175 x 300 mill reduces the number of band rolling passes from three to two. Additionally, it ensured the specified accuracy of bands and reduced the equipment loads; it reduced the rolling force by 2.02 kN (9.16%) in pass 1, the rolling power by 0.083 kW (22.25%), and the rolling force by 2 kN (10.8%) in pass 2, simultaneously ensuring the specified accuracy of the band thickness at the mill outlet.

Bacterial cellulose films were prepared by stationary liquid-phase cultivation of the Gluconacetobacter hansenii strain GH-1 /2008 in Hestrin-Schramm medium with glucose as a carbon source. To functionalize the surface and immobilize Ag NPs deposited by magnetron sputtering, BC films were treated with low-pressure oxygen-nitrogen plasma. The composition and structure of the nanomaterials were studied using transmission (TEM) and scanning (SEM) electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Using electron microscopy, it was shown that on the surface of the fibrils that make up the network of bacterial cellulose, Ag particles are stabilized in the form of aggregates 5-35 nm in size. The XPS C 1s spectra show that after the deposition of Ag NPs, the relative intensities of the C-OH and O-C-O bonds are significantly reduced. This may indicate the destruction of BC oxypyran rings and the oxidation of alcohol groups. In the Ag 3d(5/2) spectrum, two states at 368.4 and 369.7 eV with relative intensities of 0.86 and 0.14 are distinguished, which are assigned to Ag-0 state and Ag acetate, respectively.

Methods-The experiment was performed in a coeducational school in Kirov (Russia). The four-month study involved 52 adolescents of both genders. During the study period, 30 physical education lessons were held in each class. Adolescents from the control group were involved in a typical program (also aimed at improving endurance), and adolescents from the experimental group additionally performed the Burpee exercise. Endurance in adolescents was assessed by means of an all-out Running 2000 m test, and short-term memory was assessed by means of the Jacobs test (tests were performed before and after the programs). Results-An analysis of variance revealed an interaction effect (F = 28.733, eta(2)(p) = 0.578 and p < 0.001, and F = 104.353, eta(2)(p) = 0.676 and p < 0.001 for the Running 2000 m test and the Jacobs test, respectively). The control group improved by 1.9% (p > 0.05) in the Running 2000 m and by 5.5% (p > 0.05) in the Jacobs test. In the experimental group, both improved significantly by 8.6% (p < 0.05) in the Running 2000 m test and by 26.0% (p < 0.05) in the Jacobs test.

The calculation results showed that the average temperature of the wire during a drawing at a speed of up to 45 m/s on straight-line drawing machines could reach 400 degrees C. Deformation heating of the wire during drawing does not exceed 60 degrees C, and heating due to sliding friction can reach 300 degrees C, depending on the friction coefficient, which ranges from 0.05 to 0.15. The average strain rates under the conditions of the modern high-speed drawing process reach 7000 s(-1). Over the course of the research, it was found that there are no conditions for the occurrence of dynamic deformation aging due to impurity atoms of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen. At the same time, at the temperature and speed parameters of the high-speed wire drawing, conditions are created for the onset of the dynamic strain aging of steel in the presence of hydrogen atoms. Therefore, during heat treatment and pickling, it is necessary to exclude the hydrogenation of steel. It has been established that in order to exclude static strain aging of steel during drawing, it is necessary to prevent heating the wire above 180-200 degrees C.;"[Radionova, Liudmila, V; Gromov, Dmitry, V; Svistun, Alexandra S.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Met, Bolshaya Semyonovskaya St 38, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Lisovskiy, Roman A.; Faizov, Sergei R.; Glebov, Lev A.; Zaramenskikh, Sergei E.; Bykov, Vitaly A.; Erdakov, Ivan N.] South Ural State Univ, Dept Met Forming, Lenin Prospect 76, Chelyabinsk 454080, Russia";"Moscow Polytechnic University; South Ural State University";Erdakov, IN (автор для корреспонденции), South Ural State Univ, Dept Met Forming, Lenin Prospect 76, Chelyabinsk 454080, Russia.;wissenschaftler@bk.ru;"Glebov, Lev/JLL-8177-2023; Radionova, Liudmila V./K-2444-2015";"Radionova, Liudmila V./0000-0001-9587-2925; Gromov, Dmitrii/0000-0001-6036-3784; Glebov, Lev/0000-0001-6484-1894; Erdakov, Ivan/0000-0003-2005-4439";;;;;42;4;4;1;4;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;2075-4701;;METALS-BASEL;Metals;SEP;2022;12;9;;;;;;;1472;10.3390/met12091472;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/met12091472;;;14;"Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Materials Science; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering";4S7RZ;;gold;;;2023-12-25;WOS:000857634600001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Design/methodology/approach: The authors put forward the hypothesis that the problems of telecommunication companies can be solved as long as new technologies of artificial intelligence will be introduced. To this end, the authors employed themethods of analyzing the publications on artificial intelligence and measuring the level of uncertainty on the telecommunications services market, as well as statistical analysis, mathematical modeling and other methods of scientific research. Findings: The authors found out that available methods of servicing, monitoring, and forecasting telecommunication companies need to be automated. They offered a method to measure the level of uncertainty on the telecommunications services market and identified the upward trend of the uncertainty indicator. Relying on this trend and the successful application of artificial intelligence in many IT technologies, the authors came to the conclusion that the introduction of artificial intelligence in telecommunication services is expedient and well-timed. It has been justified that the expected effect can be as high as in other areas. The authors outlined the segments of telecommunication services that are the most economically efficient for digital technologies. Uniqueness/value: The research is unique because it establishes the interdependence between the uncertainty of the telecommunications services market and the penetration of artificial intelligence technologies. The authors proposed a new methodology for assessing the level of uncertainty in the telecommunications services market.

The authors investigated situations of social distance, self-isolation, quarantine, as well as digital interaction platforms being developed, and their cyber resistance. Methodology: the work applied methods of regulatory analysis and assessment of the current situation of broken virus infection chain to avoid a peak in COVID-19 cases and prevent overloading the public health system affected by the pandemic; comparative and trend analysis of statistical data; content analysis methods; formalization and analogue methods; and datasets of the Institute of Scientific Communications. Results: the analysis of the implemented information interaction requires a search for a balance between the need to ensure compliance with the restriction regime introduced, human rights and freedoms, and cybersecurity in the broad sense in order to prevent unauthorized access to privacy information. Conclusions/relevance: it is necessary to disseminate the practice of cyber hygiene in Russia that should be monitored by a separate agency in the structure of the Government of the Russian Federation, similar to the Cybersecurity Agency of the European Union or the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Protection Agency of the United States.

It is established that transport as an integral part of the state economy has to organically enter the market economy and provide sustainable transport services to national economy enterprises regardless of ownership, as well as ensure passenger transportation. It is also determined that in the conditions of market relations, transport highways must perform their functions with sufficient economic benefit to keep their material and technical resources in good order, conduct an investment policy with extensive use of scientific and technological progress, as well as a social policy guaranteeing the conditions for employees' motivated work. The study reveals an association between the financial and strategic goals of transport enterprises and the minimization of their economic risks, the prevention of bankruptcy and profit margin shortfalls. It is found that transport enterprises need to strive for the overall improvement of their financial potential through increasing the components of financial potential and assessing the impact of risk factors on them: the capacity of fixed assets, the capacity of financial resources, the capacity of services, and the capacity of credit opportunities. These are the elements of transport enterprises' financial potential that ensure its desired level. It is demonstrated that of critical importance in managing the financial potential of a transport enterprise is the role of financial resources, as a subject cannot reach the desired strategic goals without them.;"[Nesterov, Evgeny Aleksandrovich; Borisov, Andrei Viktorovich] Russian Univ Transport, Moscow, Russia; [Shadskaja, Irina Gennadievna] Russian State Social Univ, Moscow, Russia; [Shelygov, Aleksandr Vladimirovich] Moscow Polytech Univ, Moscow, Russia; [Sharonin, Pavel Nikolaevich] Russian Presidential Acad Natl Econ & Publ Adm, Moscow, Russia; [Frolov, Alexander Lvovich] MIREA Russian Technol Univ, Moscow, Russia; [Lebedeva, Olga Yevgenievna] Financial Univ Govt Russian Federat, Moscow, Russia";"Russian University of Transport; Russian State Social University (RSSU); Moscow Polytechnic University; Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy & Public Administration; MIREA - Russian Technological University; Financial University Under the Government of Russian Federation";Nesterov, EA (автор для корреспонденции), Russian Univ Transport, Moscow, Russia.;;"Sharonin, Pavel/M-8768-2015; Borisov, Andrei V./R-4841-2018; Shelygov, Aleksandr/N-7139-2015";"Sharonin, Pavel/0000-0002-6346-4465; Borisov, Andrei V./0000-0002-3429-7370; Shelygov, Aleksandr/0000-0003-1082-628X";;;;;12;3;3;1;4;INT JOURNAL COMPUTER SCIENCE & NETWORK SECURITY-IJCSNS;SEOUL;DAE-SANG OFFICE 301, SANGDO 5 DONG 509-1, SEOUL, 00000, SOUTH KOREA;1738-7906;;;INT J COMPUT SCI NET;Int.

With a sharp increase in the quality of computer systems, the relevance of the development of analytical methods for the study of complex dynamic systems, including for the decomposition and creation of a modular hierarchical structure, has only increased. Proceeding from this, in the work in the application to the development of aviation simulators, the criteria for evaluating the dynamic characteristics of the object by the operator during the normal functioning of the ergatic system are determined. The main attention is paid to the short-period component of the longitudinal motion. The expansion of the spatial motion into longitudinal and transverse is carried out in terms of the roots of the characteristic polynomial of the fourth order (an example is given). A graphical-analytical method for determining the roots of a characteristic polynomial has been developed; the calculation algorithm is presented (it was effectively used in the development of a number of simulators). When studying spatial motion, it is natural to divide into separate channels. The simulation characteristics of the simulators are determined based on the corresponding simulation characteristics for each of the channels. Root methods play a special role in such studies. We restrict ourselves to systems described on each of the channels by systems of ordinary differential equations.

Limited grain boundary sliding as compared to other superplastic alloys limits the formability of Al-Mg based alloys. Grain boundary sliding intensity depends on the grain size, grain boundaries structure, and chemical composition of alloys. To improve superplastic properties of Al-Mg based alloys, we investigated the influence of a minor addition of Zn on the grain boundary relaxation effect and grain boundary sliding ability. The temperature dependence internal friction, superplastic deformation behavior, and microstructural changes during superplastic de-formation for the AA5083 alloy and Zn modified alloy were compared. A minor Zn addition of 0.7 wt% does not influence the mean grain size but decreases the relaxation strength and the activation energy of grain boundary relaxation. The mechanisms of superplastic deformation and their contributions to the total strain were analyzed using FIB-milled grids evolution on the samples' surface. Grain boundary sliding, grain ro-tations, and intragranular strain included both dislocation slip/creep and diffusional creep were involved in the deformation process. The contribution of grain boundary sliding increased from 10% to 25% for the Zn-free AA5083 alloy to 30-50% for the Zn-modified alloy. In result, a minor Zn addition proved to stimulate grain boundary sliding that decreases stress and increases strain rate sensitivity and elongation-to-failure of the studied alloy.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

Continuous wire rod mills with multi-roll passes have been developed and implemented over the past decades. These include mills with four-roll passes with mutually perpendicular rolls. The specific feature of mills with complex passes is the impossibility of conduct and the direct measurement of the workpiece dimensions in several directions during rolling. The paper studies the development of a system for indirect control over complex section geometry by adjusting the interstand space tension with simultaneous compensation for changes in rolling forces. The paper contribution is the first justification of a technique for the control over the indirect rolled product section on mills with multi-roll passes based on theoretical and experimental research. Analytical and experimental dependencies between the metal pressure on the rolls and the semifinished rolled product temperature, rolling speed, and single drawing have been obtained for various steel grades. The impact of process factors on the rolled product section geometry when rolling in stands with four-roll passes has first been studied. The automated control system implementing the proposed technique has passed pilot tests on a continuous five-stand mill. The processes occurring in closed-loop speed and torque control systems under controlling and disturbing effects have been experimentally studied. Implementing the proposed algorithms indirectly confirmed the reduced impact of tension and pressure on the section geometry.;"[Radionov, Andrey A.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Automat & Control, 38 Bolshaya Semyonovskaya St, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Petukhova, Olga, I; Khramshin, Vadim R.] Nosov Magnitogorsk State Tech Univ, Power Engn & Automated Syst Inst, 38 Lenin Ave, Magnitogorsk 455000, Russia; [Erdakov, Ivan N.] South Ural State Univ, Dept Met Forming, Chelyabinsk 454080, Russia; [Karandaev, Alexander S.] South Ural State Univ, Dept Informat Measuring Equipment, Chelyabinsk 454080, Russia; [Loginov, Boris M.] South Ural State Univ, Dept Mechatron & Automat, 76 Lenin Ave, Chelyabinsk 454080, Russia";"Moscow Polytechnic University; Nosov Magnitogorsk State Technical University; South Ural State University; South Ural State University; South Ural State University";Erdakov, IN (автор для корреспонденции), South Ural State Univ, Dept Met Forming, Chelyabinsk 454080, Russia.;erdakovin@susu.ru;"Khramshin, Vadim/AGY-6621-2022; Radionov, Andrey/P-4418-2015; Karandaev, Alexander Sergeevich/I-5687-2014";"Khramshin, Vadim/0000-0003-0972-2803; Radionov, Andrey/0000-0002-3914-4429; Loginov, Boris/0000-0003-3337-3148; Erdakov, Ivan/0000-0003-2005-4439; Karandaev, Alexander Sergeevich/0000-0002-2671-0241";Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation [FENU-2020-0020, 2020071GZ];Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation;Research was funded by the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation under a subsidy for a government-funded basic research project, Contract No. FENU-2020-0020 (2020071GZ).;;78;4;4;0;2;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;2504-4494;;J MANUF MATER PROC;J.

Further, the authors put forward a new diagnostic method. It stipulates for an additional high-frequency measuring loop formed in an operating transformer. This dielcometric measuring capacitor cell includes a stray capacitance generated by the transformer winding and core. The monitoring of the dependence between the physico-technological oil parameters and the measuring cell capacity is fundamental for the procedures for determining the composition and properties of the transformer oil filling this cell. High-frequency low-voltage is the output signal. To prevent the cross-impact of low-frequency high-voltage and high-frequency low-voltage circuits, the pilot high-frequency low-voltage is excited by a special coupling capacitor; the output to the power feeder is conducted through an appropriate low-frequency choke, where the measuring capacitor cell does not disturb the normal transformer operation. The key physical processes used for the monitoring are analyzed and described in detail. The authors develop an algorithm to compute the current resistances of both the transformer oil and its impurities. The transformer state is estimated by comparing the parameters specified with preset permissible limits. A structure flowchart based on two synchronous quadrature detectors is proposed for a high-frequency measuring loop. The monitoring system considered allows for determining the following insulating oil properties by using the algorithm for processing the recorded data: moisture content; dielectric losses due to the accumulation of aging products in the oil and its pollution; and the content of dissolved gases in the oil. The monitoring system operability and efficiency are confirmed by appropriate experimental studies. The experiments are conducted using a TM-25-6/0.4 oil-filled transformer with a capacity of 25 kVA in a steady-state operating mode at a load current of 25 A. It is found that the proposed control system allows for identifying a critical defect of increased moisture content in the oil with no more than 10% error, and a sensitivity threshold in the order of tenths of ppm.";"[Bryakin, Ivan V.] Natl Acad Sci Kyrgyz Republ, Inst Mech Engn & Automat, Bishkek 720010, Kyrgyzstan; [Bochkarev, Igor V.] Kyrgyz State Tech Univ, Dept Electromech, Bishkek 720010, Kyrgyzstan; [Khramshin, Vadim R.] Nosov Magnitogorsk State Tech Univ, Power Engn & Automated Syst Inst, Magnitogorsk 455000, Russia; [Gasiyarov, Vadim R.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Automat & Control, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Liubimov, Ivan V.] South Ural State Univ, Dept Mechatron & Automat, Chelyabinsk 454080, Russia";"National Academy of Sciences of the Kyrgyz Republic (NAS KR); Razzakov Kyrgyz State Technical University; Nosov Magnitogorsk State Technical University; Moscow Polytechnic University; South Ural State University";Khramshin, VR (автор для корреспонденции), Nosov Magnitogorsk State Tech Univ, Power Engn & Automated Syst Inst, Magnitogorsk 455000, Russia.;"bivas2006@yandex.ru; elmech@mail.ru; hvrmgn@gmail.com; gasiyarovvr@gmail.com; liubimoviv@susu.ru";"Khramshin, Vadim/AGY-6621-2022; Gasiyarov, Vadim/D-5003-2015; Бочкарев, Игорь Викторович/HNS-4330-2023";"Khramshin, Vadim/0000-0003-0972-2803; Gasiyarov, Vadim/0000-0001-9635-4716; Бочкарев, Игорь Викторович/0000-0002-9873-9203; Bryakin, Ivan/0000-0001-7463-8072";;;;;27;1;1;1;7;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;2075-1702;;MACHINES;Machines;AUG;2022;10;8;;;;;;;630;10.3390/machines10080630;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/machines10080630;;;14;"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Engineering, Mechanical";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Engineering;4B0PQ;;gold;;;2023-12-25;WOS:000845491500001;View Full Record in Web of Science

The numerical simulation of the interaction of a laser pulse with a primary aluminum target has been carried out in the two-dimensional xz version of the KARAT PIC (particle-in-cell) code in two stages. First, the proton flux from the back side of the Al target on which the laser pulse is incident has been calculated. Second, B-11(p, 3 alpha) and B-11(p, n)C-11 reactions induced by the proton beam in the boron target have been simulated. The calculations have shown that the total yield of alpha particles is N-alpha = 7.2 x 10(8), the number of alpha particles with energies above 0.5 MeV that reach a detector is 2 x 10(7), which is 2.8% of their total yield, and the total yield of neutrons is Y-n = 10(5).

For thousands of years, human beings attempted to realise and manage their lifestyles, and governments have tried to influence the lifestyles of their people. Nevertheless, the definition of lifestyle and its conceptualisation is relatively new. Lifestyle means the specific method of living of an individual, group or community. Lifestyles include a set of values, behaviours, moods and tastes that can refer to the interests, opinions, behaviours and behavioural orientations of an individual, group or culture. The Islamic way of life follows a grand plan of behaviour according to which all life is a movement to get closer to God. This plan, however, is dynamic and always demands adjustment. In a desirable religious life, all actions and situations can be called worship. People's lifestyles and the path they choose for themselves are deeply related to their success in life. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the effect of the Islamic lifestyle on the academic success of Russian Muslim students in 2021. In total, 2000 graduate students of Kazan, Russia were studied in this research. According to the results of mean analysis in SPSS, the academic success of the students who followed the Islamic lifestyle was reported to be higher than the mean level (more than 3 out of 5). Furthermore, according to the Structural Equation Modeling in LESREL, the Islamic lifestyle has a positive significant effect on the students' academic success (p-value: 0.83; t-value: 7.92).

The research is based on the analysis of the decoration of the Ilyichevo quiver as a unique artefact featuring the scene of torturing by predators of three biological genera: a bird, an animal, and a reptile. The study of the sources supplying information on the ancient Iranians' zoological classifications and the analysis of a zoological, anatomical, subject, and material codes for reconstruction allow the author to reveal the background of the Scythian classification of the mythological animal world. The latter comprised: the habitat corresponding to the specific zone of the mythological Universe; the way of movement; and the characteristic of nutrition. This paper offers a reconstruction of the semiotic status of the quiver/gorytos against the background of the analysis of the Scythian art and written sources.

Automation of production processes is the main area in which production is currently advancing around the world. Everything that was previously performed by the person himself, his functions, not only physical but also intellectual, are gradually transferred to automation systems that perform technological cycles and exercise control over them. The purpose of the article is to analyze the effect of automation on the ability to store grain in elevators. The main research question is what factors should be considered when introducing an automation system into the grain storage process at elevators to improve the efficiency of process control at enterprises. To solve the question posed, a qualitative study was conducted using the method of an expert survey. The article reveals the factors that affect the quality of grain; the tasks implemented in the computerized process control system (CPCS) and management information and control system (MICS); the factors that hinder the grain elevator automation; the tasks solved by the automation of grain elevators in the framework of autonomous subsystems and integrated automatic control systems (ACS). It is concluded that the implementation of automation in the process of grain storage in elevators leads to an increase in grain quality, increased productivity, reduction or elimination of losses caused by theft and the peculiarities of grain storage, saving energy resources, minimizing the impact of the human factor, as well as the risks of accidents. At that, the inclusion of non-standard tools in the MICS and CPCS makes it easier to solve several current automation problems.

The pedagogical experiment was carried out based on a comprehensive school, in the city of Kirov, Russia. The study involved children 15-16 years old in the amount of 52 people. During the study period, 30 physical education lessons were held in each class. Children from the control group were engaged in the usual program, and children from the experimental group additionally performed the Burpee exercise. Endurance in children was determined by the test 2000 m, and the coordination abilities were determined by the test Shuttle run 3x10m. After the pedagogical experiment, the indicators in the control group in the 2000 m test improved by 1.9% (p>0.05), and in the Shuttle run 3x10m by 3.5% (p>0.05). In the experimental group, the performance improved significantly in the 2000 m test by 9% (p<0.05) and in the Shuttle run 3x10m by 12.4% (p<0.05). If 15-16-year-old schoolchildren perform the Burpee exercise in physical education classes, then the indicators of endurance and coordination abilities will improve significantly.

The assumption of the existence of sequencedependent preparation times has not been observed in the literature on the issue of flexible workflow without unemployment. In this study, a mixed integer programming model for the problem is first developed. Since the problem under study is one of the NP-hard problems and the mathematical model solving software is not able to obtain the optimal solution of relatively large problems at a reasonable time, to provide a meta-heuristic method of genetic algorithm to obtain optimal solutions or close to optimal for the problem. The computational results show the relatively good performance of the genetic algorithm for solving problems in less time than the mathematical programming model.;"[Kurniady, Dedy Achmad] Univ Pendidikan Indonesia, Bandung, Indonesia; [Denih, Asep] Univ Pakuan, Fac Math & Nat Sci, Bogor, Indonesia; [Vagabov, Mahach] Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Humanities, Moscow, Russia; [Rijanto, Tri] Univ Negeri Surabaya, Fac Engn, Surabaya, Indonesia; [Artemova, Elena Igorevna] Kuban State Agr Univ, Krasnodar, Russia; [Hoi, Huynh Tan] Ho Chi Minh City Open Univ, Fac Business Adm, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; [Liu Zhaojun] Gansu Univ Polit Sci & Law, Lanzhou, Peoples R China; [Nuryani, Lilis Holisoh; Komariah, Aan] Univ Pendidikan Indonesia, Educ Adm, Bandung, Indonesia";"Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia; Moscow Polytechnic University; Universitas Negeri Surabaya; Kuban State Agrarian University; Ho Chi Minh City Open University; Gansu University of Political Science & Law; Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia";Kurniady, DA (автор для корреспонденции), Univ Pendidikan Indonesia, Bandung, Indonesia.;"dedy_achmad@upi.edu; aan_komariah@upi.edu";liu, zhao/GXV-6141-2022;Komariah, Aan/0000-0003-2269-3592;;;;;39;1;1;1;5;KOREAN INST INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERS;SEOUL;VICTORIA BLDG RM 509, 705-1 YEOKSAM-DONG, KANGNAM-GU, SEOUL, 135-080, SOUTH KOREA;1598-7248;2234-6473;;IND ENG MANAG SYST;Ind.

Considering the process of high-frequency glow discharge formation on the surface of an electrode and in an electrolyte solution, we obtained the results on the destruction of renal calculi in vitro. It was shown that the destruction of kidney stones by glow discharge plasma was caused by several processes-the plasma induced effect of hydrated electrons and shock wave effect of the electrolyte stimulated by electrical breakdowns in the plasma. The plasma generation modes were configured by estimating the thickness of the vapor-gas layer in which the plasma burns. Thus, the average rate of contact destruction of renal calculi was measured depending on the plasma generator input power and time of plasma exposure. We conclude that the method of stone fragmentation by high-frequency electrolyte plasma is rather perspective and can be used in endoscopic urology for percutaneous and transurethral lithotripsy.;"[Belov, Sergej, V; Danileyko, Yury K.; Pishchalnikov, Roman Y.; Gudkov, Sergey, V; Egorov, Alexej, V; Lukanin, Vladimir, I; Sidorov, Vladimir A.; Tsvetkov, Vladimir B.] Russian Acad Sci, Prokhorov Gen Phys Inst, Moscow, Russia; [Ali, Stanislav K.; Kondrashev, Sergey, V; Bezrukov, Evgeny A.; Glybochko, Petr, V] Sechenov First Moscow State Med Univ, Minist Hlth Russian Federat, Moscow, Russia; [Rotanov, Evgeny G.; Shakhovskoy, Andrei, V] KG Razumovsky Moscow State Univ Technol & Managem, Moscow, Russia; [Andreev, Stepan N.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Moscow, Russia";"Russian Academy of Sciences; Prokhorov General Physics Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences; Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation; Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University; K.G.

The present study reflected on the Islamic society, wherein ethical leadership has been one of the most effective factors in its continuation of life and success, with a vital role in its growth, development and progress. Accordingly, the relationship between ethical leadership and the voice of Muslim employees in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, in 2021, as the statistical population (n = 2500) was analysed. For this purpose, a standard questionnaire was used to collect the necessary data, whose validity was confirmed by the construct validity in the Linear Structural Relations (LISREL) software and its reliability was checked via the Cronbach's alpha in the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software. Besides, path analysis was utilised to test the research hypothesis. Confirmatory factor analysis was correspondingly implemented to examine the data. Ultimately, the study results revealed a significant positive relationship between ethical leadership and the voice of Malaysian Muslim employees (p = 0.80; t = 5.02).

The distinctive features of the algorithm are combining the methods of Viola-Jones and the convolutional networks, the application of two complementary classifiers, working in the usual gray color and inverted color. Also, the distinguishing feature is that the identified tubers are processed by the classifiers only once, regardless of the time in front of the video camera. The Viola-Jones method was used to identify individual tubers on the conveyor belt, and the convolutional networks were only used to recognize damaged tubers. Moreover, two complementary networks were used for classification, one of which worked in gray gradation and the other in inverted color. The algorithm was implemented using the OpenCV library in Python. Testing was carried out in conditions close to the conditions of potato storage at vegetable bases. The percentage of properly-recognized damaged tubers was 92,1%.;"[Osipov, Aleksey] Financial Univ Govt Russian Federat, Shcherbakovskaya 38, Moscow 105187, Russia; [Filimonov, Andrey; Suvorov, Stanislav] Moscow Polytech Univ, Bolshaya Semyonovskaya 38, Moscow 107023, Russia";"Financial University Under the Government of Russian Federation; Moscow Polytechnic University";Osipov, A (автор для корреспонденции), Financial Univ Govt Russian Federat, Shcherbakovskaya 38, Moscow 105187, Russia.;;"Suvorov, Stanislav/AFR-2542-2022; Osipov, Aleksey/AAB-5151-2022";"Suvorov, Stanislav/0000-0002-4931-1155; Osipov, Aleksey/0000-0002-1261-8559";;;;;20;4;4;1;1;SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG;CHAM;GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND;0302-9743;1611-3349;"978-3-030-87986-0; 978-3-030-87985-3";LECT NOTES ARTIF INT;;;2021;12854;;;;;;193;201;;10.1007/978-3-030-87986-0_17;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-87986-0_17;;;9;"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Mathematics, Applied";Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S);"Computer Science; Mathematics";BT2MT;;;;;2023-12-25;WOS:000811817300017;View Full Record in Web of Science

Hot deformation was carried out with uniaxial compression of cylindrical specimens on a Gleeble 3800 thermomechanical simulator. It is shown that the flow stress increased with a decrease in the deformation temperature and an increase in the strain rate. The shape of the stress-strain curves indicates that, at high temperatures and low strain rates, the hot deformation of AISI 321 steel was accompanied by dynamic recrystallization. The passage of dynamic recrystallization was confirmed by microstructural studies. Hyperbolic sine type of constitutive equation with deformation activation energy Q = 444.2 kJ center dot mol(-1) was established by analyzing the experimental flow stresses. The power-law dependences of the critical strain necessary for the onset of dynamic recrystallization and the size of recrystallized grains on the Zener-Hollomon parameter were established. The value of the parameter Z = 5.6 x 10(15) was determined, above which the dynamic recrystallization was abruptly suppressed in the steel under study. It is speculated that the suppression of dynamic recrystallization occurs due to dispersed precipitates of titanium carbonitrides.;"[Radionova, Liudmila, V] Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Met, Bolshaya Semyonovskaya St 38, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Perevozchikov, Danil, V; Makoveckii, Aleksandr N.; Eremin, Victor N.] Chelyabinsk Pipe Rolling Plant, Mashinostroiteley St 21, Chelyabinsk 454129, Russia; [Akhmedyanov, Alexander M.; Rushchits, Sergey, V] South Ural State Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Phys & Chem Mat, Lenin Prospect 76, Chelyabinsk 454080, Russia";"Moscow Polytechnic University; South Ural State University";Radionova, LV (автор для корреспонденции), Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Met, Bolshaya Semyonovskaya St 38, Moscow 107023, Russia.;"radionovalv@rambler.ru; danil.perevozchikov@chelpipegroup.com; aleksandr.makoveckiy@chelpipegroup.com; veremin@chelpipegroup.com; akhmedianovam@susu.ru; rushchitcsv@susu.ru";"Radionova, Liudmila V./AAF-2239-2019; Radionova, Liudmila V./K-2444-2015";"Radionova, Liudmila V./0000-0001-9587-2925; Radionova, Liudmila V./0000-0001-9587-2925";;;;;33;6;6;1;8;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;1996-1944;;MATERIALS;Materials;JUN;2022;15;12;;;;;;;4057;10.3390/ma15124057;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ma15124057;;;12;"Chemistry, Physical; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering; Physics, Applied; Physics, Condensed Matter";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Chemistry; Materials Science; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering; Physics";2M0ZY;35744114;Green Published, gold;;;2023-12-25;WOS:000817440100001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Impainting is used both to improve the visual perception of an image and in classical recognition and robotics problems in order to remove irrelevant information from an image. Modern methods of impainting use neural networks. However, these approaches have drawbacks that do not allow the use of these algorithms in the practice of computer vision. In this article, we propose to use a nonlocal means (NLM) filter, which has proven itself to be excellent in image noise reduction tasks. The basis of our motivation is the fact that the goal of the NLM, like any method for recovering images distorted by noise, is to minimize the distance (or error by some criterion) between the original image and the reconstructed one. The result of computer experiments showed that the proposed method of impainting is superior to other methods according to peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) criterion. The effectiveness of the proposed filter is also shown with the help of illustrations to the article, so that the reader can compare the quality of different processing options visually.;"[Karnaukhov, V.

Most of the existing studies have used spherical particle models to analyze the mixing behavior, and it is difficult to truly understand the mechanical properties of asphalt mixtures in the mixing chamber. In this study, the discrete element similarity theory and dimensional analysis method were used to establish an engineered asphalt mixture particle model, and the validity of the model was verified by conducting a slump test. Based on these test results, the discrete element method was used to analyze the mixing behavior of the asphalt mixture, and the effect of the structural parameters of the mixing chamber on the mixing time of the asphalt mixture was investigated. The experiment was designed using the orthogonal test method, and a regression model was established based on the experimental data. The PSO algorithm was used to optimize the structural parameters of the mixing chamber. The results show that the mixing time of the coarse aggregate is reduced by 19.31%, the mixing time of the fine aggregate is reduced by 36.36%, and the mixing time of the powder is reduced by 33.33%.;"[Cheng, Haiying] Changan Univ, Natl Engn Lab Highway Maintenance Equipment, Xian 710064, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Fan, Kangkang; Feng, Shiming] Inner Mongolia Univ Technol, Coll Mech Engn, Hohhot, Inner Mongolia, Peoples R China; [Seliverstov, N.

The live-sounding speech of a teacher is the true historical form of paideia as such and the technique of maieutics in particular. Any intermediary, even a writing process, let alone the screen, reduces the effect of pedagogical dialog and produces significant and radical changes in the understanding of meaning. The article deals with the problems of understanding in the pressing context of two turns of educational philosophy: linguistic and medial. The empirical background of these turns is represented, on the one hand, by the increasing extent of the visualized (printed, screened) word in educational procedures vs. the sounding word, and by the irreversible introduction of screen technologies, digitalization, and distance learning, on the other hand. The consideration is made through the prism of the comprehension-based approach focusing on the values and meanings of professional-pedagogical activity, namely, the systemic approach, the principles of language sign ambivalence, the method of stylistic decoding, the method of analysis of vocabulary definitions, and intertextuality.;"[Grigoryev, Sergey L.; Kortunov, Vadim V.] Russian State Agrarian Univ, Moscow Timiryazev Agr Acad Named K A Timiryazev, Dept Philosophy, Moscow, Russia; [Saenko, Natalya R.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Humanities, Moscow, Russia; [Volkova, Polina S.] Herzen State Pedag Univ Russia, Dept Mus Educ & Educ, St Petersburg, Russia";"Russian State Agrarian University - Moscow Timiryazev Agricultural Academy; Moscow Polytechnic University; Herzen State Pedagogical University of Russia";Saenko, NR (автор для корреспонденции), Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Humanities, Moscow, Russia.;rilke@list.ru;"Grigoryev, Sergey/AAD-9537-2022; Kortunov, Vadim V/AAM-4341-2020; Saenko, Natalya Ryafikovna/AAQ-5703-2020; Kortunov, Vadim Vadimovich/GLS-0793-2022";"Kortunov, Vadim V/0000-0002-6058-498X; Kortunov, Vadim Vadimovich/0000-0002-6058-498X";;;;;36;1;1;1;1;FRONTIERS MEDIA SA;LAUSANNE;AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND;;2504-284X;;FRONT EDUC;Front.

Basic numerical methods for integrating nonlinear reaction-diffusion equations with delay are considered. The focus is on the method of lines. This method is based on the approximation of spatial derivatives by the corresponding finite differences, as a result of which the original delay PDE is replaced by an approximate system of delay ODEs. The resulting system is then solved by the implicit Runge-Kutta and BDF methods, built into Mathematica.

Therefore, the relevance of this topic is due to the need to use third-party resources and tools aimed at additional verification of the text to improve the stylistic and grammar skills of future translators. The purpose of the study is to conduct an experiment to determine the impact of the use of electronic text editors on improving the stylistic and grammar skills of future translators. An electronic text editor with the highest rank was selected based on an expert survey to achieve the research goal. The students were presented with the text of the translation from Russian into English for editing to conduct an experimental study. The results of the pedagogical experiment have shown that the translation edit performed by students without using an electronic text editor was twice as bad as the translation edit performed by students using an electronic text editor.

The processing of the experimental data consisted in determining the spectral characteristics of the disturbing effect from the dynamics of oscillations of the coordinates of the focal point of the lens array. To ensure sufficient resolution in the frequency domain, a sample of the original data was recorded for 10 s, which provided a resolution along the frequency axis of 1/10 Hz. The graphs of the spectral energy for the full set of wavefront aberrations calculated from the fluctuations of the lens array focal spot are shown. For a more detailed consideration, the wavefront aberrations were expanded in terms of Zernike polynomials, after which a spectral analysis of each aberration was carried out. It is shown that more than 90% of all turbulence energy is concentrated in lower-order aberrations, which makes it possible to use a bimorph mirror as a wavefront corrector, which reproduces well the lower-order aberrations.;"[Rukosuev, Alexey L.; Belousov, Vadim N.; Nikitin, Alexander N.; Sheldakova, Julia, V; Kudryashov, Alexis, V] RAS, Inst Geosphere Dynam MA Sadovsky, Moscow, Russia; [Kudryashov, Alexis, V] Moscow Polytech, Moscow, Russia";"Russian Academy of Sciences; Moscow Polytechnic University";Rukosuev, AL (автор для корреспонденции), RAS, Inst Geosphere Dynam MA Sadovsky, Moscow, Russia.;alru@nightn.ru;"Rukosuev, Alexey L/E-1272-2014; Sheldakova, Julia/E-1100-2014; Nikitin, Alexander N/E-1567-2014";"Rukosuev, Alexey L/0000-0003-3354-0460; Sheldakova, Julia/0000-0002-5160-1194; Nikitin, Alexander N/0000-0002-6636-905X";;;;;13;0;0;0;0;SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING;BELLINGHAM;1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA;0277-786X;1996-756X;"978-1-5106-4698-8; 978-1-5106-4697-1";PROC SPIE;;;2021;11916;;;;;;;;119161H;10.1117/12.2603463;http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.2603463;;;5;"Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Optics; Physics, Applied";Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S);"Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences; Optics; Physics";BT1FF;;;;;2023-12-25;WOS:000797340000052;View Full Record in Web of Science

It is extremely challenging for each state to maintain and increase it in the conditions of world economic globalization. At present, the issue of sustaining this direction of security in Russia, which joined the World Trade Organization back in 2012, is quite relevant. At the level of the country, it is extremely important to systematically analyze food security in terms of its retention and increase within the processes of globalization. The assessment of the evolutionary flow, reflecting the irreversibility, instability, imbalance of changes occurring in the economic space, also occupies an important place.

Top manufacturers of power electrics develop and adopt online monitoring systems. Such systems become part of high-voltage grid and unit transformers. However, furnace transformers are a broad category that this change does not affect yet. At the same time, adoption of diagnostic systems for furnace transformers is relevant because they are a heavy-duty application with no redundancy. Creating any such system requires a well-founded mathematical analysis of the facility's condition, carefully selected diagnostic parameters, and setpoints thereof, which serve as the condition categories. The goal hereof was to create an expert system to detect insulation breach and its expansion as well as to evaluate the risk it poses to the system; the core mechanism is mathematical processing of trends in partial discharge (PD). We ran tests on a 26-MVA transformer installed on a ladle furnace at a steelworks facility. The transformer is equipped with a versatile condition monitoring system that continually measures apparent charge and PD intensity. The objective is to identify the condition of the transformer and label it with one of the generally recognized categories: Normal, Poor, Critical. The contribution of this paper consists of the first ever validation of a single generalized metric that describes the condition of transformer insulation based on the online monitoring of the PD parameters. Fuzzy logic algorithms are used in mathematical processing. The proposal is to generalize the set of diagnostic variables to a single deterministic parameter: insulation state indicator. The paper provides an example of calculating it from the apparent charge and PD power readings. To measure the indicativeness of individual parameters for predicting further development of a defect, the authors developed a method for testing the diagnostic sensitivity of these parameters to changes in the condition. The method was tested using trends in readings sampled whilst the status was degrading from Normal to Critical. The paper also shows a practical example of defect localization. The recommendation is to broadly use the method in expert systems for high-voltage equipment monitoring.";"[Karandaev, Alexander S.; Yachikov, Igor M.] South Ural State Univ, Dept Informat Measuring Equipment, Chelyabinsk 454080, Russia; [Radionov, Andrey A.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Automat & Control, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Liubimov, Ivan, V; Druzhinin, Nikolay N.] South Ural State Univ, Dept Elect Drive & Mechatron, Chelyabinsk 454080, Russia; [Khramshina, Ekaterina A.] Nosov Magnitogorsk State Tech Univ, Power Engn & Automated Syst Inst, Magnitogorsk 455000, Russia";"South Ural State University; Moscow Polytechnic University; South Ural State University; Nosov Magnitogorsk State Technical University";Radionov, AA (автор для корреспонденции), Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Automat & Control, Moscow 107023, Russia.;"askaran@mail.ru; iachikovim@gmail.com; radionov.mail@gmail.com; liubimoviv@susu.ru; druzhinin.nn@mmk.ru; khramshinaea@gmail.com";"Radionov, Andrey/P-4418-2015; Karandaev, Alexander Sergeevich/I-5687-2014";"Radionov, Andrey/0000-0002-3914-4429; Karandaev, Alexander Sergeevich/0000-0002-2671-0241; Khramshina, Ekaterina/0000-0002-1606-4266";;;;;80;1;1;1;6;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;1996-1073;;ENERGIES;Energies;MAY;2022;15;10;;;;;;;3519;10.3390/en15103519;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en15103519;;;21;Energy & Fuels;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Energy & Fuels;1R7BD;;gold;;;2023-12-25;WOS:000803520500001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Spectroradiometer HandHeld 2, soil acidity (pH) meter, satellite GLONASS-GPS receiver of geodetic class were used for field survey. Multispectral orthophoto obtained at the time of ground surveys using multispectral cameras Tetracam Micro-MCA 4 and Tetracam ADC-micro installed on board of the Supercam-S350F UAV. In parallel with the spectrometric work, samples of soils of different soil varieties and washout degree were taken, in representative sites of elementary soil areas. Laboratory studies were carried out with the selected samples, in order to determine the main agrochemical parameters: humus (%), mobile phosphorus (mg), mobile potassium (mg), pH (H2O). The work was tested on two field sites located in the Chuvash Republic (Russia), on cultivated (arable land) forest-steppe zonal soils (leached chernozems, dark gray forest soils). As a result of mathematical data processing, statistically significant relationships were obtained between certain groups of agrochemical indicators and spectral data in different channels of UAV images for specific soil varieties. In the course of the study, relationships were found between the green, NDVI, NIR, red channels obtained using the Supercam-S350F unmanned aerial vehicle and laboratory data: humus, phosphorus, potassium and soil pH.

The paper aims to justify mutual adaptation of the functional structure of certain track and field events (pentathlon and heptathlon) and the integral effect of each of these events on sports performance in highly skilled female athletes. Materials and methods. Correlation analysis was performed for the results of pentathlon (10 best world results for each season between 2000 and 2019, 198 results in total) and heptathlon events (8 best results of each world championships between 1983 and 2019, 136 results in total). The correlation of each event with the sum of the rest of the events was found. Results. The analysis of pair correlations performed for pentathlon and heptathlon events showed their similarity with respect to functionally similar events. However, the structure of heptathlon events is more homogeneous compared with pentathlon events. The central integral event among heptathlon events is 200 metres. Throwing events contradict running events as seen from negative significant correlations between them. The effect of each of the events on the rest of the events shows that jumping events and sprinting contribute to performance enhancement while throwing events and 800 metres impede the progress. The assessment of the effect of certain events on the rest of the events showed that the long jump explained 14% of performance enhancement in heptathlon events (4% in pentathlon events), while the shot put explained 6% of performance decrease in heptathlon events (2% in pentathlon events). Conclusion. The study on the features of the functional structure of certain pentathlon and heptathlon events in case of their mutual adaptation allows to statistically predict system effects that arise as a result of performance enhancement in highly skilled female athletes.;"[Ermolaev, B.

Now, a complete, telomere-to-telomere human genome assembly (T2T-CHM13) has enabled us to comprehensively characterize pericentromeric and centromeric repeats, which constitute 6.2% of the genome (189.9 megabases). Detailed maps of these regions revealed multimegabase structural rearrangements, including in active centromeric repeat arrays. Analysis of centromere-associated sequences uncovered a strong relationship between the position of the centromere and the evolution of the surrounding DNA through layered repeat expansions. Furthermore, comparisons of chromosome X centromeres across a diverse panel of individuals illuminated high degrees of structural, epigenetic, and sequence variation in these complex and rapidly evolving regions.;"[Altemose, Nicolas; Langley, Sasha A.; Caldas, Gina, V; Karpen, Gary H.; Dernburg, Abby F.] Univ Calif Berkeley, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, 229 Stanley Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Logsdon, Glennis A.; Vollger, Mitchell R.; Eichler, Evan E.] Univ Washington, Sch Med, Dept Genome Sci, Seattle, WA USA; [Bzikadze, Andrey, V] Univ Calif San Diego, Grad Program Bioinformat & Syst Biol, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA; [Sidhwani, Pragya; Straight, Aaron F.] Stanford Univ, Dept Biochem, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Hoyt, Savannah J.; Hartley, Gabrielle A.; O'Neill, Rachel J.] Univ Connecticut, Inst Syst Genom, Storrs, CT USA; [Hoyt, Savannah J.; Hartley, Gabrielle A.; O'Neill, Rachel J.] Univ Connecticut, Dept Mol & Cell Biol, Storrs, CT USA; [Uralsky, Lev; Rogaev, Evgeny, I] Sirius Univ Sci & Technol, Soci, Russia; [Uralsky, Lev; Shepelev, Valery A.; Gusev, Fedor; Rogaev, Evgeny, I; Alexandrov, Ivan A.] Vavilov Inst Gen Genet, Moscow, Russia; [Ryabov, Fedor D.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Moscow, Russia; [Shew, Colin J.; Dennis, Megan Y.] Univ Calif Davis, Sch Med, Genome Ctr, MIND Inst, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Shew, Colin J.; Dennis, Megan Y.] Univ Calif Davis, Sch Med, Dept Biochem & Mol Med, Davis, CA 95616 USA; [Sauria, Michael E.

The changes in the Vickers hardness from 61 to 110 HV during strip rolling and quantitative relations between the hardness and mechanical properties of the samples obtained during tensile testing were determined experimentally. Linear equations were obtained for converting the HV hardness values to Brinell (HB) hardness values. Equations were obtained for determining the hardness values (HV and HB) based on the percent reduction of copper strips after cold rolling. The results of the tests and measurements were used to establish correlations between the mechanical properties (yield strength, ultimate strength, and percent elongation) of the metal and the Vickers (HV) and Brinell (HB) hardness values of copper strips of known chemical composition. Linear dependences for both sigma(y) and sigma(u), as well as delta on both hardness parameters were obtained for the entire range of analyzed values. The use of the obtained data and equations at the metallurgical and machine-building plants makes it possible to determine and control the yield strength, ultimate strength, and percent elongation of sheet metal based on hardness without conducting expensive tensile testing of the samples.;"[Shatalov, R.

It treats both cases of different diffusion coefficients and identical diffusion coefficients. The study describes a few different techniques to solve the system of interest, including (i) reduction to a single second-order linear ODE without delay, (ii) reduction to a system of three second-order ODEs without delay, (iii) reduction to a system of three first-order ODEs with delay, (iv) reduction to a system of two second-order ODEs without delay and a linear Schrodinger-type PDE, and (v) reduction to a system of two first-order ODEs with delay and a linear heat-type PDE. The study presents many new exact solutions to a Lotka-Volterra-type reaction-diffusion system with several arbitrary delay times, including over 50 solutions in terms of elementary functions. All of these are generalized or incomplete separable solutions that involve several free parameters (constants of integration). A special case is studied where a solution contains infinitely many free parameters. Along with that, some new exact solutions are obtained for a simpler nonlinear reaction-diffusion system of PDEs without delays that represents a special case of the original multi-parameter delay system. Several generalizations to systems with variable coefficients, systems with more complex nonlinearities, and hyperbolic type systems with delay are discussed. The solutions obtained can be used to model delay processes in biology, ecology, biochemistry and medicine and test approximate analytical and numerical methods for reaction-diffusion and other nonlinear PDEs with delays.;"[Polyanin, Andrei D.; Zhurov, Alexei, I] Russian Acad Sci, Ishlinsky Inst Problems Mech, 101 Vernadsky Ave,Bldg 1, Moscow 119526, Russia; [Polyanin, Andrei D.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Chem Engn & Biotechnol Dept, 38 Bolshaya Semenovskaya St, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Zhurov, Alexei, I] Cardiff Univ, Coll Biomed & Life Sci, Heath Pk, Cardiff CF14 4XY, Wales";"Russian Academy of Sciences; Ishlinsky Institute for Problems in Mechanics RAS; Moscow Polytechnic University; Cardiff University";"Polyanin, AD; Zhurov, AI (автор для корреспонденции), Russian Acad Sci, Ishlinsky Inst Problems Mech, 101 Vernadsky Ave,Bldg 1, Moscow 119526, Russia.;Polyanin, AD (автор для корреспонденции), Moscow Polytech Univ, Chem Engn & Biotechnol Dept, 38 Bolshaya Semenovskaya St, Moscow 107023, Russia.;Zhurov, AI (автор для корреспонденции), Cardiff Univ, Coll Biomed & Life Sci, Heath Pk, Cardiff CF14 4XY, Wales.";"polyanin@ipmnet.ru; zhurovai@cardiff.ac.uk";"Zhurov, Alexei I/P-4410-2014; Polyanin, Andrei D/E-5121-2015";"Zhurov, Alexei I/0000-0002-5594-0740; Polyanin, Andrei D/0000-0002-2610-0590";Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation, Russia [AAAA-A20-120011690135-5, AAAA-A20-120092190052-9];Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation, Russia(Ministry of Education and Science, Russian Federation);The study was supported by the Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation, Russia within the framework of the State Assignment (Reg.

In view of both the fundamental understanding and the technological importance of these alloys, the exact knowledge of the equilibrium phase diagram, metastable phases, and the transition rates between different phase states towards equilibrium are necessary and require further clarification. We have studied the influence of alloy composition, annealing temperature and annealing time (up to 1800 h) on the metastable-to-equilibrium phase transitions in binary Fe-Ga using a coherent set of complementing methods, including diffraction methods (X-ray and neutron diffraction), scanning electron microscopy, and electron backscatter diffraction. We propose several important changes to the low-temperature part of the binary Fe-Ga diagram close to the Fe-rich corner and a new method based on interdiffusion couples for varying the structure and phase states of Fe-Ga alloys.;"[Mohamed, A.

The study object of the present article is the process of uncovering unique cultural and historical context through a game format using modern information technologies, namely, virtual reality and augmented reality. The study subject of the study is a set of participants in the Crimean viticulture and winemaking, namely, winegrowers, winemakers, tourism and logistics companies, hospitality enterprises, tourists, and vacationers at Russian resorts that are part of wine-growing regions or are located in reasonable proximity from a logistical viewpoint. The research subject is the relationship of these participants with the research object. The problem of low demand for traditional Russian wines in the national consumer market is solved through the employment of information and communication technologies, which are a kind of information technology.;"[Kiselev, Vladimir; Petropavlovskaya, Alla; Fedorova, Anna; Plyushcheva, Larisa] Plekhanov Russian Univ Econ, Moscow, Russia; [Kiseleva, Tatyana] Kemerovo State Univ, Kemerovo, Russia; [Gorokhova, Anna] Moscow Polytech Univ, Moscow, Russia";"Plekhanov Russian University of Economics; Kemerovo State University; Moscow Polytechnic University";Kiselev, V (автор для корреспонденции), Plekhanov Russian Univ Econ, Moscow, Russia.;gorokhovaa.e@mail.ru;"Kiselev, Vladimir M./B-6746-2014; Gorokhova, Anna/HKW-7448-2023; Gorokhova, Anna/I-1733-2017";"Kiselev, Vladimir M./0000-0003-0401-5659; Gorokhova, Anna/0000-0002-5820-1687";;;;;14;0;0;0;5;UNIV NACL INGENIERIA;MANAGUA;PO BOX 5595, MANAGUA, 00000, NICARAGUA;1818-6742;1995-9516;;NEXO REV CIENT;Nexo Rev.

It is shown that the electroluminescence spectrum of the new dye is red-shifted by 12 nm compared with its photoluminescence spectrum in a toluene solution. This result is explained by the presence of an anthracene-based group in the new coumarin dye, which prevents the formation of a dimeric structure in the organic light-emitting diode (OLED) active layer. Therefore, exciton emission prevails in electroluminescence in contrast to coumarin 6 emission caused by dimers. With the same OLED structures and almost identical I-V curves, significant differences in the voltage-luminance characteristics are observed, which are explained by the difference in electron mobilities of the studied compounds.;"[Vashchenko, A.

The Society paid the main attention to the study of ancient archeology, as well as the history of the development of the Novorossiysk Territory. The historiography of the Society's activities includes an analysis of various aspects of the Society's activities, biographies of its members and works on the history of antiquity. The study of the Society's activities in the field of scythology is considered for the first time, which is the novelty of this article. The Scythians made a significant contribution to world culture, therefore, the opening of each new page in the study of the history of this people seems relevant. On the example of the Odessa Society of History and Antiquities, the state policy of the House of Romanovs in the field of protection of archaeological monuments can be traced, which manifested itself in the august patronage of the Society and annual subsidies for its needs. Scientists of the Odessa Society of History and Antiquities were the pioneers of the historical and geographical research of the Northern Black Sea region. They looked for analogies in the geographical objects of Novorossiya with the reports of ancient authors about the Scythians, made attempts at a historical interpretation of archaeological monuments, and used chemical methods for analyzing finds. Historiographic reviews of works on Scythology carried out by members of the Society acquainted the Russian public with the latest achievements in this field. Epigraphic and numismatic research, publications of the epistolary heritage of Russian archaeologists were carried out at a high level for their time. It is no coincidence that the members of the Society were prominent domestic and foreign scythologists and scholars of antiquity, such as M.I. Rostovtsev, N.P. Kondakov, V.V. Latyshev, N.I.

J;Zima, VN;;;;Zima, Vadim N.;;;Real Time and Perspectives of Modern Metaphysics;VOPROSY FILOSOFII;;;Russian;Article;;;;;;"real time; metaphysics; individual substances; ultimate reality; realism; transcendentalism; naturalism; physicalism";;One of the features of modern philosophy is the revival of interest in classical metaphysical problems (the nature of the mental, free will, time) and their active discussion. However, the state of affairs in modern metaphysics is rather ambiguous. While some researchers try to solve metaphysical problems within a certain tradition, others seek alternative ways, and others deny the very possibility of metaphysics as a positive knowledge, or at least to focus on discussing the question of its methods and actual possibilities. Strictly speaking, taking into account the difficulties that the thesis about the possibility of obtaining knowledge about objective reality has faced over the past centuries, there is nothing fundamentally new in this state of affairs. There are still two main questions that remain relevant, without an answer to which it is impossible to say that the solution to any metaphysical problem is coherent. Is metaphysics even possible as a positive knowledge of reality? If possible, how? The author believes that the arguments from the side of transcendentalism against naturalism are quite effective, and it is necessary to abandon the search for solutions to metaphysical problems that are compatible with naturalism. But this does not mean that metaphysical problems cannot be solved at all. According to the author, the perspectives of metaphysics can be associated with the search for other points of reference than those that are usually used in modern discussions. As such, we can take the idea of the objectivity of time, which is of crucial importance in modern metaphysics.;[Zima, Vadim N.] Moscow Polytech Univ, 38 Bolshaya Semyonovskaya Str, Moscow 107023, Russia;Moscow Polytechnic University;Zima, VN (автор для корреспонденции), Moscow Polytech Univ, 38 Bolshaya Semyonovskaya Str, Moscow 107023, Russia.;vadim-zima@yandex.ru;Zima, Vadim/AHC-1309-2022;;;;;;14;0;0;0;0;RUSSIAN ACAD SCIENCES-INST PHILOSOPHY;MOSCOW;UL VOLHONKA, DOM 14-1, STR 5, MOSCOW, 119991, RUSSIA;0042-8744;;;VOP FILOS;Vopr.

The impact of the price parameters of the world oil market and the tools of its regulation on the sustainability of OPEC++-participating countries was assessed using panel regression analysis. The sustainable development level of OPEC++-participating countries was analyzed by the integrated estimation method, focusing on crude oil market functioning features. Undoubtedly, we can testify that there is a direct correlation between the country's level of socio-economic development and sustainable development. In resource economies, a reduction in oil production and exports cannot have the same effect on sustainable development as in countries that do not produce oil, or are characterized by a higher level of economic development. With an appropriate level of economic diversification and the effectiveness of the institutional framework for managing the oil market, sustainable development can be achieved. Based on the model of the integrated assessment of the sustainable development of oil-exporting countries, the impact of statistically significant financial investors' panic factor on the imbalance of oil prices due to the uncertainty of economic development was determined. Key indicators that create a panic factor in the oil market were identified. These include the indicators of the number of countries enforcing lockdown and the pandemic's duration. We argue for the need to develop an effective strategy for achieving the sustainable development goals (SDGs) in OPEC++-participating countries, based on the management of crude oil supply and demand forces and by considering the effect of financial investors' panic factor on the oil market.;"[Vasiljeva, Marina V.] Autonomous Nonprofit Org Publishing House Sci Rev, 9 Maly Sukharevsky Lane,Bld 1, Moscow 127051, Russia; [Ponkratov, Vadim V.] Financial Univ Govt Russian Federat, Dept Publ Finance, 49 Leningradsky Ave, Moscow 125993, Russia; [Vatutina, Larisa A.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Management, 38 Bolshaya Semyonovskaya Str, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Volkova, Maria V.] Bauman Moscow State Tech Univ, Dept Ind Logist, 5 2nd Baumanskaya Str,Bld 1, Moscow 105005, Russia; [Ivleva, Marina I.] Plekhanov Russian Univ Econ, Higher Sch Social Sci & Humanities, Hist & Philosophy Dept, 36 Stremyanny Lane, Moscow 117997, Russia; [Romanenko, Elena, V] Siberian State Automobile & Highway Univ SibADI, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Econ & Enterprise Management, 5 Mira Ave, Omsk 644080, Russia; [Kuznetsov, Nikolay, V] State Univ Management, Dept Finance & Credit, 99 Ryazansky Ave,Bld 1, Moscow 109542, Russia; [Semenova, Nadezhda N.] Natl Res Mordovia State Univ, Fac Econ, Dept Finance & Credit, 68 Bolshevistskaya Str, Saransk 430005, Russia; [Kireeva, Elena F.] Belarus State Econ Univ, Dept Taxes & Taxat, 26 Partizanskiy Ave, Minsk 220070, BELARUS; [Goncharov, Dmitrii K.] Plekhanov Russian Univ Econ, Dept Informat, 36 Stremyanny Lane, Moscow 115054, Russia; [Elyakova, Izabella D.] North Eastern Fed Univ, Dept Econ & Finance, 58 Belinsky Str, Yakutsk 677000, Russia";"Financial University Under the Government of Russian Federation; Moscow Polytechnic University; Bauman Moscow State Technical University; Plekhanov Russian University of Economics; State University of Management; Mordovian State University; Plekhanov Russian University of Economics; North-Eastern Federal University in Yakutsk";Vasiljeva, MV (автор для корреспонденции), Autonomous Nonprofit Org Publishing House Sci Rev, 9 Maly Sukharevsky Lane,Bld 1, Moscow 127051, Russia.;"marina.vasilleva2017@gmail.com; ponkratovvadim@yandex.ru; larissavatutina@yandex.ru; marle.volkova@yandex.ru; marina.ivleva.2014@inbox.ru; elenaromanenko25@yandex.ru; nikolay.kuznetsov53@gmail.com; nadezhda_semenova_1980@bk.ru; professor.kireeva@gmail.com; dmitriik.goncharov@inbox.ru; izabella.elyakova@yandex.ru";"Ivleva, Marina I/U-1997-2017; Shtern, Natalia/ADG-9384-2022; Ponkratov, Vadim/Q-9425-2017";"Ponkratov, Vadim/0000-0001-7706-5011; Vasiljeva, Marina/0000-0003-1033-7734";;;;;91;0;0;1;9;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;2071-1050;;SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL;Sustainability;APR;2022;14;8;;;;;;;4742;10.3390/su14084742;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su14084742;;;23;"Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies";"Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI)";"Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology";0S1PW;;gold;;;2023-12-25;WOS:000786054900001;View Full Record in Web of Science

This error is caused not only by the hysteresis of chasing the wind flow direction fluctuations by yaw system, but also by periodical wind flow deviation from the rotating blades. In this research the authors have proved the yawing error phenomenon by experimental observation and numerical simulation, and have found the analytic solution to significant reduction of yawing error.The experiment with the SWT-3.6-120 HAWT nacelle based weather vane has proved the periodical nature of wind flow oscillations caused by the rotating blades. The numerical Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modeling of the wakes behind the rotating blades, on the base of the Navier-Stokes equations and k-epsilon turbulence model, has shown the similar picture on the nacelle top, which is considered as the input signal set for the weather vane and hence a yaw system. The periodical yawing error caused by the flow deviation was named as a differential error of yawing.The similarity of the experimental and modeling results allowed then using the Matlab Simulink software for functional modeling of the weather vane behavior with yawing error estimation and evaluation of the corresponding power reduction. Using the series of simulation experiments it was determined that the integration of compensator with the yaw control system would lead to considerable yaw differential error reduction and increase the output power at least on 3.37%. The developed approach may become a basic method for the built-in differential yaw error reduction algorithm for any and all HAWTs.;"[Solomin, Evgeny V.] South Ural State Univ, Chelyabinsk, Russia; [Terekhin, Aleksandr A.; Ismagilov, Denis R.] South Ural State Univ, Aerosp Engn, Chelyabinsk, Russia; [Martyanov, Andrey S.] South Ural State Univ, Elect Engn, Chelyabinsk, Russia; [Kovalyov, Anton A.] South Ural State Univ, Power Engn, Chelyabinsk, Russia; [Ryavkin, Gleb N.] South Ural State Univ, Elect & Elect Engn, Chelyabinsk, Russia; [Shishkov, Aleksandr N.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Moscow, Russia";"South Ural State University; South Ural State University; South Ural State University; South Ural State University; South Ural State University; Moscow Polytechnic University";Solomin, EV (автор для корреспонденции), South Ural State Univ, Chelyabinsk, Russia.;nii-uralmet@mail.ru;"Martyanov, Andrey/AAU-6241-2020; Shishkov, Alexander Nikolaevich/A-4517-2014";"Martyanov, Andrey/0000-0002-9997-9989; Shishkov, Alexander Nikolaevich/0000-0001-9851-8745; Ryavkin, Gleb/0000-0002-7637-0310";"Russian Foundation for Basic Research, Agreement RFBR [20-48-740002\20 (000742020474)]; ERAZMUS+; Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece";"Russian Foundation for Basic Research, Agreement RFBR; ERAZMUS+; Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece";The presented research was funded by Russian Foundation for Basic Research, Agreement RFBR #20-48-740002\20 (000742020474) of 27.01.2021 on the base of Project-Training Education at South Ural State University (National research university), Russia and the ERAZMUS+ supported Project with the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece.;;27;9;9;6;13;PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD;OXFORD;THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND;0196-8904;1879-2227;;ENERG CONVERS MANAGE;Energy Conv.

As predicted non-isothermal cyclic deformation takes place with wave effects, which are a result of the combination of heating and cyclic mechanical loading.

Considering the language as an actual and at the same time a virtual phenomenon, the authors justify the synonymic character of lexemes Word, Number (V. Nalimov), Sound (A. Makarevich), Music (N. Bobyleva), Emotion (V. Shakhovskiy), Gesture (A. and N. Ustiny). Starting with the binary oppositions, rational-irrational, verbal-nonverbal, discrete-continual, real-virtual, authors suggest a linguistic (psycholinguistic) perspective in the process of interpretation of such religious phenomena as the Trinity and theepy Cross.

The Agrifac HEXX TRAXX harvester with an installed computer vision system was investigated. A video camera (24 fps) was installed above the turbine, which receives the dug-out beets after the digger and is connected to a single-board computer. At the preprocessing stage, static and insignificant image details were revealed. Canny edge detector and excess green minus excess red (ExGR) method were used. The identified areas were excluded from the image. The remaining areas were glued with similar areas of another image. As a result, the number of images entering the second stage of preprocessing was reduced by half. Then Otsu's binarization was used. The main stage of image processing is divided into two sub-stages: detection and classification. The improved YOLOv4-tiny method was chosen for root crop detection using a single-board computer (SBC). This method allows processing up to 14 images of 416 x 416 pixels with 86% precision and 91% recall. To classify root crop damage, we considered two algorithms as candidates: 1. bag of visual words (BoVW) with a support vector machine (SVM) classifier using histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) and scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) descriptors; 2. convolutional neural networks (CNN). Under normal lighting conditions, CNN showed the best accuracy, which was 99%. The implemented methods were used to detect and classify blurred images of sugar beetroots, which were previously rejected. For improved YOLOv4-tiny precision was 74% and recall was 70%.

The measured alpha-particle yield per pulse in the reaction B-11(p, 3 alpha) is 10(9) particles in 4 pi sr at the above laser-pulse parameters. The results of a numerical particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation of the nuclear-fusion reaction B-11(p, 3 alpha) proceeding in a solid-state boron target are presented.

Zernike approximation is well-known, well-established and widely used technique. And in most cases the quality of approximation is good enough, especially if the measured light beam has circular aperture. But when the light beam is rectangular or ringshaped (for example, if one need to measure the surface flatness of the detail that is ring-shaped), the approximation using Zernike polynomials fails. In this work we implemented the approach of the approximation of the wavefront using Bspline polynomials.

For the experiments, structures were formed of metal-sublayer-semiconductor wafer Al-(Ti, Ni, Mo)-Si. The quality control of the deposited films was carried out microscopically by the four-probe method. The presented results indicate the solid-phase interaction of components during diffusion annealing Si-Me-Al thin-film systems. This rearrangement of atoms, which occurs with grain-boundary diffusion, significantly affects the electrical and thermal characteristics of the formed contacts.

The numerical model was developed by the smoothed particle method, and its verification was carried out using experimental data on the motion of a bubble flow in a tube. The minimum size of smoothed particles and their required number to build a correct computational model have been determined. Structural and hydraulic characteristics of the flow in the presence of phase transitions have been obtained. The calculated data on the three-dimensional spatial distribution of the vapor phase and pressure losses both over the cross section of the unit cell formed by the dispersed backfill and along the entire length of the channel are given. The analysis of the dynamics of changes in pressure losses along the length of the tube has been carried out; two characteristic sections with different dynamics of the growth of pressure losses have been found. Data were obtained on the distribution of the volumetric steam content in the tube at its various positions: horizontal, vertical, and with an inclination of 45 degrees. The influence of the angle of inclination of the tube on the character of the distribution of steam over its cross section is shown. In this case, the greatest difference in the structure is observed between the vertical and horizontal positions. It has also been demonstrated that its structure tends to be homogeneous as the flow moves. The calculation model used made it possible to determine pressure loss in the working section from the inlet of the vapor-liquid flow into the tube to the outlet under conditions corresponding to the onset of the critical flow regime. Comparison of the results of numerical calculations, including the critical mass flow rates at the outflow of a vapor-liquid flow from the tube, with the available experimental data and previously obtained results of analytical studies, noted their good match.";"[Khramtsov, D.

The diffusion mechanism of contact melting was confirmed. From the analysis of the melting nature of aluminium metallisation tracks (up to 7 mu m thick), the optimal modes of contact melting were revealed in the Al-Si system. Such modes existed with current pulses up to 6.5 x 10(10) A/m(2). In the case of an increase in the amplitude of the current pulses, the contact melting rate increases, but at the same time, there is a significant heterogeneity in the thickness of the metal film along the length of the metallisation track.

These connections play a leading role in improving the quality of professionally oriented training of future specialists. The purpose of the article is to determine the impact of innovative technologies of STEM education on the quality of learning of educational material through a physical experiment. The article experimentally substantiates the effectiveness of using the STEM approach when performing laboratory work to form the studied physical concepts in comparison with traditional teaching methods. It has been shown that the use of the STEM approach improves the level of assimilation of concepts in comparison with traditional teaching methods. In the case of using the STEM approach, the number of students with a high level of assimilation of concepts increases significantly, while the number of students with a low level decreases, which proves the effectiveness of using the STEM approach for the formation of high-level knowledge and skills. The article highlights the features of the formation of the STEM component in teaching in the innovative educational and scientific environment of the technical university, as well as the features of the teaching methodology taking into account STEM-learning technologies.

The development of human capital as the main resource, capable of ensuring the further viability of humanity and finding effective solutions to global problems, is an urgent strategic task of the modern economy and society in general. This fact explains the closer attention of both scientists and practitioners to the factors influencing the process of constructive formation and effective development of human capital. As shown by numerous studies and analyses of the evolutionary development of human society and scientific and technological progress, one of the key factors influencing the development of human capital is culture. Contemporary political-economic and socio-economic studies and theories suggest that the development of all socially significant processes, including human capital, is influenced not so much by culture as by the social environment. In the present article, the development of human capital is considered through the prism of the impact of socio-cultural environmental factors, which in many ways can meet a person's social needs, depending on the level of his development and self-organization, which is currently one of the most popular skills called soft skills.;"[Semenova, Valeriia Valerevna; Gorokhova, Anna Evgenevna; Gasanbekov, Sergey Kurbanovich] Moscow Polytech Univ, Moscow, Russia; [Gurtskoy, Lev Dmitrievich] Rostov State Med Univ, Rostov Na Donu, Russia; [Kalitko, Svetlana Alekseevna] Kuban State Agr Univ, Krasnodar, Russia";"Moscow Polytechnic University; Rostov State Medical University; Kuban State Agrarian University";Semenova, VV (автор для корреспонденции), Moscow Polytech Univ, Moscow, Russia.;"alisavalera@rambler.ru; agor_80@mail.ru; levang@mail.ru; kalitkosvetlana@mail.ru; gasanbekovserg@rambler.ru";"Gorokhova, Anna/I-1733-2017; semenova, valeria/HHZ-0593-2022; Gasanbekov, Sergey/GNP-4711-2022; Gorokhova, Anna/HKW-7448-2023";"Gorokhova, Anna/0000-0002-5820-1687; semenova, valeria/0000-0001-6879-8205;";;;;;18;0;0;0;2;UNESP-FACULDADE CIENCIAS & LETRAS;ARARAQUARA;DEPT CIENCIAS EDUCACAO, RODOVIA ARARAQUARA-JAU, KM 1-CAIXA POSTAL 174, ARARAQUARA, SP 14800-901, BRAZIL;1519-9029;;;REV LINE POLIT GEST;Rev.

The study aimed to develop an optimal CT protocol in terms of safety and reliability. For this, we assessed the inter-observer agreement between CT and low-dose CT (LDCT) with soft and sharp kernels using a semi-quantitative severity scale in a prospective study (Moscow, Russia). Two consecutive scans with CT and LDCT were performed in a single visit. Reading was performed by ten radiologists with 3-25 years' experience. The study included 230 patients, and statistical analysis showed LDCT with a sharp kernel as the most reliable protocol (percentage agreement 74.35 +/- 43.77%), but its advantage was marginal. There was no significant correlation between radiologists' experience and average percentage agreement for all four evaluated protocols. Regarding the radiation exposure, CTDIvol was 3.6 +/- 0.64 times lower for LDCT. In conclusion, CT and LDCT with soft and sharp reconstructions are equally reliable for COVID-19 reporting using the CT 0-4 scale.

According to the results of the research, it was found that the sources of higher harmonic ones are the ATP-500 traction substations, connected to the 6 kV network in groups and alone. In the 6 kV network, the 3rd, 5th, 7th and 11th harmonics of the canonical series, as well as the 3rd, 4th, 6th and 8th harmonics of the non-canonical series, are distinguished, the levels of which significantly exceed the permissible levels according to GOST. The presence of non-canonical harmonics is caused by the asymmetry of the bridge circuit (current asymmetry relative to the abscissa axis). An instruction has been developed for the pre-start check of the bridge circuit gates to eliminate asymmetry. The prevalence of 5 and 7 higher harmonics in the 6 kV network was established and it was recommended to take into account the possibility of resonance phenomena in the pulse phase control circuits of electric drives connected to the 6 kV network of the mine and open pit. The implementation of the recommendations set forth in the work increases the reliability of the bridge circuits of traction substations and eliminates the possibility of the appearance of non-canonical harmonics, which improves the voltage quality in accordance with the requirements of GOST.;"[Klyuev, R., V] Moscow Polytech Univ, Moscow, Russia; [Fomenko, O.

The most demanded and dynamic part of the labor market is currently represented by engineering specialists. However, successful professional and career growth, as well as the effective development of human capital as the main resource of the innovative development of modern society, requires a combination of engineering (hard skills) and humanitarian (soft skills) abilities in a specialist. The development of many socially significant processes in modern society demonstrates aggravated contradictions and the development of new realization trends many of which are associated with changes in the parameters of these processes which, in turn, is determined by the mass implementation of innovative digital technologies and globalization processes. Globalization as a process ensuring the accessibility and openness of information has a significant impact on the transformation of national values within a country in favor of the emergence of global social, moral, and legal values and social behavior norms in the field of political and state power, as well as the economy. Leadership as a social phenomenon bearing the main load of managing all socially significant processes is also changing. Leadership as a social phenomenon is subject to constant scientific study and analysis.

The entire range of literature and sources used in this article is divided into three groups, which include works on the history of archaeological knowledge, works on state policy in the field of archaeology and directly works on Scythian archaeology. A review of the literature shows that despite the increased interest in the history of archaeological knowledge, the policy of the House of Romanov and the Russian government on the development of Scythian archaeology has not been specifically investigated. Under the Scythian archeology in this work, the study of the European Forest-Steppe, Steppe, Crimea and the Kuban is considered, although if we interpret this concept in the perspective of Scythian-Siberian unity, it is necessary to expand the scope of the study and analyze the expeditions of Russian scientists to Siberia and the fate of the Siberian collection of Peter I. The attention of the Romanov House to Scythian archaeology was expressed in the personnel policy, which dictated the principles of choosing the leaders of the excavations of the richest Scythian mounds. They were initially military, and later - major scientists who occupied a high social position. The main role in the study of the Scythian mounds was played by the Archaeological Commission, called the Imperial Commission. The Russian government and the Imperial House personally spared no expense to research the Scythian mounds, archaeologists received government awards and ranks. An ambiguous situation developed with attempts to suppress predatory excavations of Scythian mounds by landowners, peasants and impostor archaeologists. In general, the experience of the development of Scythian archaeology on the part of the reigning dynasty and the Russian government seems useful today, when black archeology is flourishing on the territory of modern Russia and Ukraine.;"[Kokorina, Yulia G.; Vagabov, Machach M.; Rogozhkin, Vasily A.; Verniaev, I.

P.";;;Comparative Analysis of the Techniques of Calculating the Parameters of Sheet Leveling on a Roller Leveler;RUSSIAN METALLURGY;;;English;Article;;;;;;"leveling of rolled sheets; roller leveler (RL); leveling parameter calculation techniques";;The traditional theories of leveling rolled sheets on a roller leveler (RL) according to Korolev's technique and the Tselikov-Smirnov technique are theoretically analyzed. According to Korolev's technique, the moment of internal forces for the elastoplastic bending of a sheet for the ith roller in RL is shown to be determined by setting a linear law of changing the coefficient of plastic deformation penetration across the sheet thickness from the second to the penultimate RL roller. According to the Tselikov-Smirnov technique, the maximum bending moment is assumed for the second, third, and fourth rollers in RL for alternating bending of a sheet in the plastic zone. The minimum bending moment for bending in the elastic zone is assumed for the three penultimate RL rollers on alternating bending of a sheet. In the remaining RL rollers, the bending moments are taken to be intermediate. The discrepancy between the electric motor powers of the main drive calculated by the Tselikov-Smirnov technique and Korolev's technique is found to be 17.2% for seven-roller RL, 13.6% for nine-roller RL, 16.2% for eleven-roller RL, 16.7% for thirteen-roller RL, and 17.1% for seventeen-roller RL. A comparative analysis of the main drive power of RL shows that the load of the main drive motor of RL calculated by the Tselikov-Smirnov technique is higher than that calculated by Korolev's technique by 13.6-17.2%. This fact allows us to correctly choose the installed electric motor power when designing new and modifying the existing RLs.;"[Maksimov, E. A.] ZAO Intrai, Chelyabinsk 454092, Russia; [Shatalov, R.

A fine-grained structure and a uniform distribution of mechanical properties over the thickness, length and width of rolled brass sheets allows rolled brass products to be used for deep drawing on stamping complex shaped products. One of the ways to decrease the anisotropy of the properties is to turn a sheet before the second pass. The effect of changing the direction of sheet rolling by turning on the structure and mechanical properties of brass L63 is studied on a laboratory two-high 150 x 235 mill. A computer simulation of the cold rolling process is carried out using the DEFORM-3D software package. A comparison of the simulation results with the results of a laboratory experiment on a sheet mill demonstrates the possibility of using DEFORM-3D to predict the stress distribution in the deformation zone in rolling depending on the metal forming conditions. The DEFORM-3D software package is found not to estimate the effect of changes in the grain size and shape on stresses during rolling with turning. The experimental results show that rolling of sheets with turning can decrease the anisotropy of properties, and the efficiency of rolling with turning increases when the reduction increases to 30-40%.;"[Shatalov, R.

The pedagogical experiment lasted for 3 months in an ordinary school in Russia. The study involved seventh-graders in the number of 40 children aged 13-14 years. In the experimental group, students performed exercises with a differentiated load depending on their typology, which was determined using a tapping test. Strength and speed qualities were evaluated by three tests: long jump, trunk lift, flexion, and extension of the arms. Speed endurance was evaluated by the test - jump over the rope. After the study, in the control class, in children that have a strong nervous system, indicators of speed-strength improved by 2-3%, and speed-endurance indicators increased by only 8%, and with a weak by 2-4%, and speed-endurance indicators became higher by 6%. The indicators in children from the experimental class in the subgroup that have a strong nervous system improved by 13-14%, and the indicators of speed endurance increased by 19%. In children that have a weak nervous system, the speed-strength qualities indicators increased by 11-16%, and the qualities of speed endurance increased by 23%. If you perform a set of exercises for the development of speed and power abilities in physical education classes at school, both speed-powerabilities and the qualities of speed endurance indicators will increase.

Forced water cooling of the welded joints is found to increase the ultimate tensile strength of the weld, slightly changing the properties of the welded joint. As compared to welding in air, the FSW of the 1151T alloy leads to an increase in the microhardness of the mixing zone by 20% and a decrease in the grain size in it from 9.8 to 4.8 mu m. For both the 1151T and 1565chN116 alloys subjected to FSW in water, the length of the heat-affected zone decreases by about 1.6-2.2 times as compared to FSW in air. An increase in the cooling rate during FSW causes an increase in the intercrystalline corrosion resistance of all zones of the welded joint by a factor of 1.4-1.7. The increase in the intercrystalline corrosion resistance is maximal in the heat-affected zone.;"[Ovchinnikov, V. V.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Moscow 115280, Russia; [Drits, A.

The emphasis is placed on the concept of implementing project activities in the educational process in the context of the implementation of the Federal State Educational Standard and on the consideration of various practices and approaches to the implementation of this concept. The introduction of innovative methods in higher education and practice-oriented approaches in training related to professional fields have been developed in the training of students for a bachelor's degree in publishing. The complexity of production processes and the formation of a complex of creative, organizational, legal, technological, and communication components directly affect the nature of the activity and form requirements for the competencies of a modern specialist in the media industry. This leads to a revision of approaches and the introduction of new teaching methods. At the forefront is the formation of resource links with professional industries and the implementation of the idea of training specialists who can quickly adapt to changing economic conditions and solve production problems. The project method is an important tool for the professional motivation of students for it allows them to participate in the development and creation of a project, to see the final product that has been accepted into production, has passed full publishing preparation, and has been materialized. The method of integrating projects into the educational process allows structuring and organizing students' independent work and experimental research. Within the framework of the practice-oriented approach to teaching at Moscow Polytechnic University, various subjects of both the educational and professional environment are involved in the organization of projects so that students form the scientific and practical competencies of a BA in publishing. An innovative approach to teaching students majoring in publishing and journalism is present in various areas of training and in various formats. Moscow Polytechnic University implements diverse practices involving the use of innovative methods for solving professional problems. Among them are the use of interactive forms of conducting classes, participation in project activities, development of bachelor's thesis topics based on the development of publication projects, participation in practice-oriented events related to publishing. The bachelor's curriculum includes disciplines related to the modeling of publications, the formation of projects of publications and publishing houses. The bachelor's thesis is made on the basis of a project of a publication or a publishing house; it involves research in the field of publishing management, organization of the editorial and publishing process in a publishing house, development of a marketing plan for a modem publishing house.

The study period was three months. All physical education classes were held for 40 minutes and twice a week. Students from the control class (20 children) studied based on the common program, and students from the special group (20 children) further carried out a set of speed and strength exercises. All students performed the tapping test (strength of the nervous system) and the Bourdon test (concentration of attention). After a special study, the concentration values in the control class in kids with a strong nervous system improved by 5% (p>0.05) and with a weak one - by 6% (p>0.05). In the experimental class, concentration indicators increased by 13% (p<0.05) in schoolchildren with a strong nervous system and with a weak one - by 16% (p<0.05). It is necessary to perform a group of physical exercises that affect the development of strength and speed abilities in physical education classes at school. Physical activity for students aged 13-14 years should be differentiated considering the strength of the nervous system. As a result, the indicators of strength and speed qualities will improve and the indicators of students' concentration.

A number of cluster analysis tools for processing the initial data set and their software implementation are analyzed, as well as the complexity of the application of cluster data analysis. An approach to data is generalized from the point of view of factual material that supplies information for the problem under study and is the basis for discussion, analysis and decision-making. Cluster analysis is a procedure that combines objects or variables into groups based on a given rule. The work provides a grouping of multivariate data using proximity measures such as sample correlation coefficient and its module, cosine of the angle between vectors and Euclidean distance. The authors proposed a method for grouping by centers, by the nearest neighbor and by selected standards. The results can be used by analysts in the process of creating a data analysis structure and will improve the efficiency of clustering algorithms.The practical significance of the results of the application of the developed algorithms is expressed in the software package created by means of the C ++ language in the VS environment.;"[Silin, Andrey V.] D Mendeleev Univ Chem Technol Russia, Novomoskovsk Inst, Novomoskovsk, Russia; [Grinyuk, Olga N.] D Mendeleev Univ Chem Technol Russia, Novomoskovsk Inst, Career Guidance Ctr, Novomoskovsk, Russia; [Lartseva, Tatyana A.; Aleksashina, Olga V.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Moscow, Russia; [Sukhova, Tatiana S.] Natl Res Univ, Moscow Aviat Inst, Moscow, Russia";"Moscow Polytechnic University; Moscow Aviation Institute";Silin, AV (автор для корреспонденции), D Mendeleev Univ Chem Technol Russia, Novomoskovsk Inst, Novomoskovsk, Russia.;;"Aleksashina, Olga/AAC-2647-2022; Lartseva, Tatyana/AAH-2681-2020";"Aleksashina, Olga/0000-0002-8780-8613; Lartseva, Tatyana/0000-0002-8645-7348";;;;;24;0;0;0;1;UNIV AMAZONIA;FLORENCE;SEDE PRINCIPAL CALLE 17 DIAGONAL 17 CON CARRERA 3F-BARRIO PORVENIR, FLORENCE, 00000, COLOMBIA;;2322-6307;;AMAZON INVESTIG;AMAZON.

It has been established that the sanitary quality and safety of meat products depends on many factors, including the place of manufacture, the time of year, the capacity of the meat processing enterprise. It has been proved that high-quality meat products in sanitary terms are produced at large meat processing enterprises, less high-quality ones are produced by individual entrepreneurs and in most cases, low-quality ones are produced at low-tonnage meat processing enterprises. It has been revealed that not all meat products meet the sanitary requirements for the content of nitrites. A microbiological express method for determining the toxicity of meat products using Colpoda steinii infusoria has been proposed, which, according to the reliability of the results obtained, is identical to the classical method and corresponds to the production conditions of certified laboratories. To improve the quality and safety of meat products, it has been proposed to use a dye that is made from the blood of slaughtered animals by stabilizing it with table salt and treating it with an alcoholic solution of acetic acid, which gives the sausages a stable lasting color.;"[Semak, Anna Eduardovna; Cherepanova, Nadezhda Gennadevna; Prosekova, Elena Alexandrovna] Russian State Agr Univ, Moscow Timiryazev Agr Acad RSAU MSAA, Dept Morphol & Vet Sanit Expertise, Inst Zootech & Biol, Moscow, Russia; [Kazakova, Ekaterina Vladimirovna] Russian State Agr Univ, Inst Food Technol, Dept Storage & Proc Technol Anim Origin Produce, Moscow Timiryazev Agr Acad RSAU MSAA, Moscow, Russia; [Altunina, Julia Olegovna] Moscow Polytech Univ, Fac Econ & Management, Dept Advertising & Publ Relat Media Ind, Moscow, Russia";"Russian State Agrarian University - Moscow Timiryazev Agricultural Academy; Russian State Agrarian University - Moscow Timiryazev Agricultural Academy; Moscow Polytechnic University";Semak, AE (автор для корреспонденции), Russian State Agr Univ, Moscow Timiryazev Agr Acad RSAU MSAA, Dept Morphol & Vet Sanit Expertise, Inst Zootech & Biol, Moscow, Russia.;semak.a.e@mail.ru;"Черепанова, Надежда/AAY-3743-2021; Semak, Anna/AAD-7645-2022; Казакова, Екатерина/AFM-8717-2022; Просекова, Елена/AAY-3891-2021; Altunina, Yulia/AAG-7558-2021";"Черепанова, Надежда/0000-0001-7484-9021; Казакова, Екатерина/0000-0001-6082-4771; Просекова, Елена/0000-0003-1819-0618; Altunina, Yulia/0000-0003-4213-5328; Semak, Anna/0000-0002-1968-4284";;;;;14;0;0;0;3;ENTOMOLOGY & APPLIED SCIENCE RESEARCH LETTERS-EASLETTERS;HARAYANA;CYBER CITY, DLF PHASE 2, GURGAON-122002, HARAYANA, 00000, INDIA;2349-2864;;;ENTOMOL APPL SCI LET;Entomol.

A field-programmable gate array is used as the main AOS control element, which provides a closed loop AOS bandwidth of up to 2000 Hz. The WFS is used to estimate the characteristic bandwidth of the generated turbulence nu(turb). Changes in the spatial and temporal spectra of the laser radiation phase, as well as the quality of the beam during its dynamic phase correction at various AOS frequencies, are analysed.

The mentioned reduction is especially significant if the disparity space is 2D or 3D. The proposed method can be applied in the well-known dynamic programming (DP) approach for stereo and motion. In this case, the general 2D problem of the global discrete energy minimization has been reduced to several mutually independent sub-problems of one-dimensional minimization, and an exact solution has been obtained for each sub-problem. A new modification of DP techniques, which we call extended dynamic programming for energy minimization (EDP), has been also presented in this paper. The EDP method is used if an approximation of the general 2D discrete energy minimization problem is considered. In this case, the proposed recursive minimum search (RMS) algorithm is an essential part of the EDP method. Using the EDP algorithm, we have obtained a lower energy than the graph cuts expansion technique on stereo and motion problems.;"[Karnaukhov, V. N.; Kober, V., I; Mozerov, M.

However, this assumption is generally incorrect if we take into account the presence of noise in the images and the different illumination of the left and right images of the stereo-pair. In addition, pixel-by-pixel mapping does not work in areas where there is no real texture. Therefore, it is important to develop and use robust local features based on a certain neighborhood of the pixels being matched. In this study, we have developed and proposed to use a completely new local feature based on the Walsh-Hadamard transform. The transform in a local 8 x 8 window is easily encoded into a 64-bit value comparable in Hamming distance. The accuracy of such matching surpasses the use of a robust census feature that is close to the principle. Moreover, combining both features allows us to achieve the best stereo matching for methods that are not based on deep learning schemes.;"[Karnaukhov, V. N.; Kober, V., I; Mozerov, M.

Decomposition of the wavefront in terms of Zernike polynomials is a standard procedure that traditionally is used to investigate the set of existing aberrations. In addition, the spectral analysis of the wavefront dynamics makes it possible to estimate the fraction of the energy distributed between different Zernike modes. It is shown that the fraction of energy related to the low-order polynomials is higher compared to the high-order polynomials. Also, one of the consequences of Taylor's hypothesis is confirmed-low-order aberrations are slower compared to the higher-order ones.;"[Rukosuev, Alexey; Nikitin, Alexander; Belousov, Vadim; Sheldakova, Julia; Toporovsky, Vladimir; Kudryashov, Alexis] Russian Acad Sci, Sadovsky Inst Geosphere Dynam, Leninskiy Pr 38-1, Moscow 119334, Russia; [Kudryashov, Alexis] Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Phys, Bolshaya Semyonovskaya Str 38, Moscow 107023, Russia";"Russian Academy of Sciences; Sadovsky Institute of Geosphere Dynamics of the Russian Academy of Sciences; Moscow Polytechnic University";Rukosuev, A (автор для корреспонденции), Russian Acad Sci, Sadovsky Inst Geosphere Dynam, Leninskiy Pr 38-1, Moscow 119334, Russia.;"alru@nightn.ru; nikitin@activeoptics.ru; belousov@activeoptics.ru; sheldakova@nightn.ru; topor@activeoptics.ru; kud@activeoptics.ru";"Nikitin, Alexander N/E-1567-2014; Rukosuev, Alexey L/E-1272-2014; Kudryashov, Alexis/E-1280-2014; Toporovsky, Vladimir/AAH-3970-2019; Sheldakova, Julia/E-1100-2014";"Nikitin, Alexander N/0000-0002-6636-905X; Rukosuev, Alexey L/0000-0003-3354-0460; Kudryashov, Alexis/0000-0002-7856-2834; Toporovsky, Vladimir/0000-0002-8172-5171; Sheldakova, Julia/0000-0002-5160-1194";"RUSSIAN SCIENCE FOUNDATION [19-19-00706]; Russian Science Foundation [19-19-00706] Funding Source: Russian Science Foundation";"RUSSIAN SCIENCE FOUNDATION(Russian Science Foundation (RSF)); Russian Science Foundation(Russian Science Foundation (RSF))";FundingThis research was funded by the RUSSIAN SCIENCE FOUNDATION, grant number 19-19-00706.;;23;8;8;0;1;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;2076-3417;;APPL SCI-BASEL;Appl.

In the former, conciliation is the most developed alternative dispute resolution mechanism, while in the latter, mediation is the most developed. In order to deepen this comparison, a qualitative research of interpretative nature has been developed with the support of bibliographic-documentary material. The main conclusion is that access to justice is a human right that has been positivized as a fundamental right in the constitutions of both Colombia and Russia. However, the Colombian Constitution allows individuals to exercise their jurisdictional functions on a temporary basis, unlike the Russian Constitution, which only authorizes judges from the Federation to exercise their jurisdictional functions. While conciliation in Colombia is developed and implemented through State-supervised Conciliation and Arbitration Centers, mediation in Russia is in its initial phase and has gradually gained acceptance in society. In both states, the implementation of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms has been driven by the need to decongest the courts and tribunals of ordinary justice. Therefore, it is useful to insist on the massive use of these instruments to make possible a justice that comes from the parties in conflict, that can repair the relations of the subjects in dispute and that tends towards the construction of more peaceful societies.;"[Arrieta Lopez, Milton; Meza Godoy, Abel] Univ Costa, Barranquilla, Colombia; [Vladimirovich Afanasiev, Ilya] Financial Univ Govt Russian, Moscow, Russia; [Dmitriyevich Sekerin, Vladimir] Moscow Polytech Univ, Moscow, Russia; [Noli, Sara] Univ Norte, Barranquilla, Colombia";"Universidad de la Costa; Moscow Polytechnic University; Universidad del Norte Colombia";López, MA (автор для корреспонденции), Univ Costa, Barranquilla, Colombia.;"miltonarrieta@yahoo.com; abelrmg@yahoo.es; ivafanasev@fa.ru; bcintermarket@yandex.ru; saranoli@hotmail.it";"YIP, LOK WUNG/AEK-1107-2022; Arrieta-López, Milton/Y-6821-2019; Sekerin, Vladimir/C-7426-2014";"Arrieta-López, Milton/0000-0002-3437-5025; Sekerin, Vladimir/0000-0002-2803-3651";;;;;27;0;0;2;7;UNIV SIMON BOLIVAR;BARRANQUILLA;CARRERA 54 NO 64-223, BARRANQUILLA, 00000, COLOMBIA;0124-7441;2590-4566;;JUSTICIA;Justicia;JUL-DEC;2021;26;40;;;;;128;142;;10.17081/just.26.40.4773;http://dx.doi.org/10.17081/just.26.40.4773;;;15;Law;Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI);Government & Law;XK9YY;;gold, Green Published;;;2023-12-25;WOS:000727812500009;View Full Record in Web of Science

RO blended diesel fuel (DF) and emulsified multicomponent biofuels have been investigated. Fuel physicochemical properties have been analyzed. Experimental tests of a diesel engine D-245 in the operating conditions of the external characteristic curve and the 13-mode test cycle have been conducted to investigate the effect of these fuels on engine performances. CFD simulations of the nozzle inner flow were performed for DF and ethanol-emulsified RO. The possibility of a significant improvement in brake thermal efficiency of the engine has been noted. The efficiency of using blended biofuels from RO as a motor fuel for diesel engines has been evaluated based on the experimental test results. It was shown that in comparison with the presence of RO in emulsified multicomponent biofuel, the presence of water has a more significant effect on NOx emission reduction. The content of RO and the content of water in the investigated emulsified fuels have a comparable influence on exhaust smoke reduction. Nozzle inner flow simulations show that the emulsification of RO changes its flow behaviors and cavitation regime.;"[Markov, Vladimir Anatolyevich; Sa, Bowen; Zherdev, Anatoly Anatolyevich] Bauman Moscow State Tech Univ, Power Engn Fac, Moscow 105005, Russia; [Devyanin, Sergey Nikolaevich; Zykov, Sergey Anatolyevich] Russian State Agr Univ, Moscow Timiryazev Agr Acad, Dept Tractors & Automobiles, Moscow 127550, Russia; [Maldonado, Pablo Ramon Vallejo] Peoples Friendship Univ Russia, Acad Engn, Dept Mech & Instrumental Engn, Moscow 117198, Russia; [Denisov, Aleksandr Dmitrievich] Moscow Polytech Univ, Kolomna Inst Branch, Dept Mech Engn & Comp Aided Design Syst, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Ambawatte, Hewage Chithral] Univ Ruhuna, Fac Engn, Dept Mech & Mfg Engn, Galle 80000, Sri Lanka";"Bauman Moscow State Technical University; Russian State Agrarian University - Moscow Timiryazev Agricultural Academy; Peoples Friendship University of Russia; Moscow Polytechnic University; University Ruhuna";Sa, BW (автор для корреспонденции), Bauman Moscow State Tech Univ, Power Engn Fac, Moscow 105005, Russia.;"vladimir.markov58@yandex.ru; bowensa@yandex.ru; devta@rambler.ru; azherdev@bmstu.ru; vallejo-prvm@rudn.ru; sabi@timacad.ru; dad_888@mail.ru; chithral@mme.ruh.ac.lk";"Ambawatte, Chithral/R-1534-2019; Vallejo Maldonado, Pablo Ramon/G-8013-2019";"Ambawatte, Chithral/0000-0003-1316-8630; Vallejo Maldonado, Pablo Ramon/0000-0001-6818-5644; Sa, Bowen/0000-0002-2912-2234";;;;;68;5;5;2;8;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;1996-1073;;ENERGIES;Energies;OCT;2021;14;20;;;;;;;6661;10.3390/en14206661;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en14206661;;;28;Energy & Fuels;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Energy & Fuels;XI9SD;;gold;;;2023-12-25;WOS:000726440700001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Later, however, the drastic overheating of the planet made the surface of Venus uninhabitable for Earth-type life forms. Nevertheless, hypothetical Venusian organisms could have gradually adapted to conditions within the cloud layer of Venus-the only niche containing liquid water where the Earth-type extremophiles could survive. Here we hypothesize that the unified internal volume of a microbial community habitat is represented by the heterophase liquid-gas foam structure of Venusian clouds. Such unity of internal space within foam water volume facilitates microbial cells movements and trophic interactions between microorganisms that creates favorable conditions for the effective development of a true microbial community. The stabilization of a foam heterophase structure can be provided by various surfactants including those synthesized by living cells and products released during cell lysis. Such a foam system could harbor a microbial community of different species of (poly)extremophilic microorganisms that are capable of photo- and chemosynthesis and may be closely integrated into aero-geochemical processes including the processes of high-temperature polymer synthesis on the planet's surface. Different complex nanostructures transferred to the cloud layers by convection flows could further contribute to the stabilization of heterophase liquid-gas foam structure and participate in chemical and photochemical reactions, thus supporting ecosystem stability.;"[Skladnev, Dmitry A.] Russian Acad Sci, Winogradsky Inst Microbiol, Biotechnol Res Ctr, Moscow 119071, Russia; [Skladnev, Dmitry A.; Kotsyurbenko, Oleg R.] Network Researchers Chem Evolut Life, Leeds LS7 3RB, W Yorkshire, England; [Karlov, Sergei P.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Urban Studies, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Khrunyk, Yuliya Y.] Ural Fed Univ, Dept Heat Treatment & Phys Met, Ekaterinburg 620002, Russia; [Khrunyk, Yuliya Y.] Russian Acad Sci, MN Mikheev Inst Met Phys, Ural Branch, Ekaterinburg 620108, Russia; [Kotsyurbenko, Oleg R.] Yugra State Univ, High Ecol Sch, Khanty Mansiysk 628011, Russia";"Russian Academy of Sciences; Research Center of Biotechnology RAS; Moscow Polytechnic University; Ural Federal University; Russian Academy of Sciences; Yugra State University";"Kotsyurbenko, OR (автор для корреспонденции), Network Researchers Chem Evolut Life, Leeds LS7 3RB, W Yorkshire, England.;Kotsyurbenko, OR (автор для корреспонденции), Yugra State Univ, High Ecol Sch, Khanty Mansiysk 628011, Russia.";"skladda@gmail.com; ekems@mospolytech.ru; iu.ia.khrunyk@urfu.ru; kotsor@hotmail.com";;"Khrunyk, Yuliya/0000-0001-9059-1198; Dmitry, SKLADNEV/0000-0001-6929-6397";;;;;66;1;1;0;11;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;2075-1729;;LIFE-BASEL;Life-Basel;OCT;2021;11;10;;;;;;;1034;10.3390/life11101034;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/life11101034;;;14;"Biology; Microbiology";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics; Microbiology";XI5OX;34685405;Green Published, gold;;;2023-12-25;WOS:000726161800001;View Full Record in Web of Science

The target of this paper is to present a system for trust management in industrial cloud computing using the multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) approach. MCDM techniques have been developed to accommodate a wide range of applications. As a result, hundreds of approaches have been generated with even minor variations on current approaches spawning new study fields. Design/methodology/approach Cloud computing provides a fully scalable, accessible and flexible computing platform for various applications. Due to the multiple applications that cloud computing has found in numerous life features, users and providers have considered providing security in cloud communications. Due to its distributive nature, dynamic space and lack of transparency in performing cloud computing, it faces many challenges in providing security. For security improvement, trust management can play a very influential role. This paper proposes a generic analytical methodology that uses a series of assessment criteria to evaluate current trust management testing prototypes in industrial cloud computing and related fields. The authors utilize a MCDM approach in the present article. Due to the multi-dimensionality of the sustainability objective and the complexities of socio-economic and biophysical processes, MCDM approaches have become progressively common in decision-making for sustainable energy. Findings The results of comparing and evaluating the performance of this model show its ability to manage trust and the ability to adapt to changes in the behavior of service providers quickly. Using a simulation, all results are confirmed. The results of simulations and evaluation of the present paper indicate that the proposed model provides a more accurate evaluation of the credibility of cloud service providers than other models. Practical implications The number of cloud services and customers is vast and extremely competitive in cloud environments, where novel cloud services and customers can join at any time, while others can withdraw whenever they want. Because of cloud services' highly dynamic and dispersed design, trust management mechanisms must be highly flexible to obtain feedback and update trust outcomes as quickly as possible. The model presented in this article tries to improve users' trust in the cloud industry. Originality/value Using a method (MCDM) to find the best trust management solution based on user experience in industrial cloud computing is the novelty of this paper.;"[Khoruzhy, Liudmila Ivanovna] Russian State Agr Univ, Moscow Timiryazev Agr Acad, Moscow, Russia; [Bulyga, Roman Petrovich] Financial Univ Govt Russian Federat, Moscow, Russia; [Voronkova, Olga Yuryevna] Altai State Univ, Barnaul, Russia; [Vasyutkina, Lidia Vladimirovna] Bauman Moscow State Tech Univ, Moscow, Russia; [Saenko, Natalya Ryafikovna] Moscow Polytech Univ, Moscow, Russia; [Poltarykhin, Andrey Leonidovich] Plekhanov Russian Univ Econ, Moscow, Russia; [Aravindhan, Surendar] Saveetha Dent Coll & Hosp, Dept Pharmacol, Saveetha Inst Med & Tech Sci, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India";"Russian State Agrarian University - Moscow Timiryazev Agricultural Academy; Financial University Under the Government of Russian Federation; Altai State University; Bauman Moscow State Technical University; Moscow Polytechnic University; Plekhanov Russian University of Economics; Saveetha Institute of Medical & Technical Science; Saveetha Dental College & Hospital";Khoruzhy, LI (автор для корреспонденции), Russian State Agr Univ, Moscow Timiryazev Agr Acad, Moscow, Russia.;liudmilakh16@gmail.com;"Saenko, Natalya Ryafikovna/AAQ-5703-2020; Khoruzhy, Liudmila/AAH-4697-2019; ARAVINDHAN, SURENDAR/R-1126-2019; VORONKOVA, Olga Yuryevna/AEO-5438-2022";"Khoruzhy, Liudmila/0000-0003-3061-1374; ARAVINDHAN, SURENDAR/0000-0002-2421-9192; VORONKOVA, Olga Yuryevna/0000-0002-3106-4643";;;;;49;0;0;0;16;EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD;BINGLEY;HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND;0368-492X;1758-7883;;KYBERNETES;Kybernetes;MAY 17;2022;51;6;;;SI;;1949;1966;;10.1108/K-05-2021-0378;http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/K-05-2021-0378;;DEC 2021;18;Computer Science, Cybernetics;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Computer Science;1I3RT;;;;;2023-12-25;WOS:000724765700001;View Full Record in Web of Science

The hypothesis is put forward those interrogative constructions serve not only, for the direct formation of interrogative statements, but also perform a secondary function of transmitting pragmatic information. Several semiotic correlates of the interrogative and discourses of various types have been revealed. An important element of the found correlations is the belonging of nonverbal and verbal discourses to the phenomenon of interrogative creativity, in particular, the French semiotic tradition.

It was found that the formation of an ordered structure upon a change in the Al or Ga content or during a phase transition upon a change in temperature leads to a decrease in the unit-cell parameter with a jump of the order of Delta a/a similar to 0.001. A specific microstructure in the form of mesoscopic clusters (L similar to 200-1000 A) with an ordered atomic structure dispersedly incorporated into a disordered or less ordered matrix can be formed in the ranges of 23 at% < x < 33 at% for Fe-xAl and 19 at% < x < 24 at% for Fe-xGa. Independent determination of the unit-cell parameters of the matrix and clusters showed their coherence, which is manifested in their coincidence or proximity with a high degree of accuracy (Delta a/a <= 0.0001). This type of phase separation (matrix + clusters) has a completely different nature with an incoherent phase coexisting in the outer or thin layers, which leads to lattice parameters difference at the level of Delta a/a similar to 0.001.

For each stress mode, the corresponding evolutionary equations governing anisotropic hardening were formulated. For describing the isotropic hardening, the evolutionary equation for the second-mode saturation parameter is introduced. The stress deviator is defined as the sum of stress deviators of the three modes. The nonlinear damage accumulation is represented by the kinetic equation based on the energy principle, where the energy equal to the work of second-mode stresses within the strain field is taken as the energy spent for damaging of the material. The material functions governing the theory are defined, the basic experiment and the identification method of the material functions are formulated.

In this paper, the mechanisms for improving the quality of scientific and technological forecasts by using the theory of inventive problem solving (TIPS, or TRIZ) when forming and verifying forecasts have been offered. In this case, the forecast results are based not only on the expert's subjective opinion but also on the objective laws of the development of the technical systems. The material has come with detailed practical examples.

The authors note that adverse or allergic reactions of medicines to the human body are possible with any medications that are prescribed or administered in a dental office. Although most of the pharmacological agents used today have a favorable profile and they are relatively safe, a modern specialist should be aware of potential adverse reactions that may occur and one should be ready to cope with any complications. Adverse or allergic reactions are possible when working with drugs such as local anesthetics, sedatives, analgesics and antibiotics, for this reason, it is necessary to study the possible reactions of the patient's body to them when administering such drugs to reduce the negative impact on the body. In general, the pharmacological arsenal of a practicing dentist is relatively safe today.

For this, it is necessary to develop an effective methodology for calculating electricity losses for individual technological mechanisms and the factory as a whole, which will make it possible to significantly reduce the energy component of costs during the production process. The main aim of the research is to develop a methodology for determining energy losses by individual technological mechanisms in various operating modes, which can be used at similar enterprises. Objects: mining and concentrating factories, which are characterized by the complexity of determining the energy characteristics of technological equipment. Methods: a combination of deterministic and probabilistic-statistical methods for determining energy losses. Deterministic methods include calculating maximum losses, average loads, graphical integration, and rms current. The probabilistic statistic ones, in their turn, are based on the study of statistical characteristics and the use of statistical samples of network schemes Results. Based on the experimental studies, a methodology has been developed for determining the energy losses in the elements of the power supply system of the concentrating factory in nominal and operational mode. It was established that the ratio of loss factors in the nominal and operational modes of operation, which determines the degree of utilization of the capacity of the cable network of 6 kV, is in the range of 1,02-2,57. On average, a 6 kV cable network is underloaded by 25-30 %. Actual electricity losses in the 6 kV cable network turned out to be less than the nominal ones and make up less than 1 % of the total electricity consumed, therefore, any measures to reduce electricity losses are impractical. The weighted average power factor for the concentration plant is 0,82, so it may be appropriate to carry out measures to compensate the reactive power. The calculation of the parameters of the compensating devices and the choice of their installation site are provided for by the work plan for the future period.;"[Klyuev, Roman, V] Moscow Polytech Univ, Ind Power Supply Dept, 33 B Semenovskaya St, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Golik, Vladimir, I; Bosikov, Igor I.; Gavrina, Oksana A.] State Technol Univ, North Caucasian Inst Min & Met, 44 Nikolaev St, Vladikavkaz 362021, Russia";"Moscow Polytechnic University; North Caucasian Institute of Mining & Metallurgy (State Technological University)";Klyuev, RV (автор для корреспонденции), Moscow Polytech Univ, Ind Power Supply Dept, 33 B Semenovskaya St, Moscow 107023, Russia.;"kluev-roman@ramler.ru; v.i.golik@mail.ru; igor.boss.777@mal.ru; Gavrina-Oksana@yandex.ru";"Golik, Vladimir Ivanovich/K-3731-2018; Klyuev, Roman/J-8000-2014; Gavrina, Oksana/HMP-7136-2023; Klyuev, Roman Vladimirovich/AAX-6549-2021";"Klyuev, Roman/0000-0003-3777-7203; Klyuev, Roman Vladimirovich/0000-0003-3777-7203; Gavrina, Oksana/0000-0002-9712-9075";;;;;20;1;1;0;0;TOMSK POLYTECHNIC UNIV, PUBLISHING HOUSE;TOMSK;30, LENIN AVE, TOMSK, 634050, RUSSIA;2500-1019;2413-1830;;BULL TOMSK POLYTECH;Bull.

The study used a questionnaire for the subjective assessment of the organization of students' independent work and valid psychodiagnostic methods for diagnosing personality characteristics of attitudes towards innovation. The study involved 52 students and 46 teachers from universities in Russia and Bulgaria. It was found that a teacher plays a leading role in organizing the independent work of students, so he/she must be able to quickly and effectively manage this process. There is a need for experience exchange, interaction of teachers within the framework of international conferences and foreign internships to improve the educational process. The study identified insufficient technological and psychological readiness of students and teachers to change the educational process associated with an orientation towards independent work; a low level of creativity of teachers has been found. Internal motivation for innovations in the educational process among students is higher than among teachers, which indicates the dissatisfaction of the former and the inertia of the latter.

Based on the results obtained, it can be concluded that the legal profession, being an institution of civil society, remains vulnerable in the legal sense in its interaction with law enforcement agencies. At the same time, by illegally interfering in promotion, public officials go unpunished. There is still no criminal liability for unlawful interference in the activities of a lawyer.

The dependences of the air filtration rate on the pressure drop for fabrics with a surface density of 0.2 and 0.37 kg/m(2) and processed materials based on them are nonlinear. The change in the parameters of air filtration in materials obtained by varying the processing rate depends on the surface density of the fabrics. When processing a fabric with a surface density of 0.2 kg/m(2), materials in which the filtration resistance and air flow modes correspond to the characteristics of the flow in the fabric were obtained. At a processing rate of 5 and 10 m/min of a fabric with a surface density of 0.37 kg/m(2), materials in which, compared to the fabric, the filtration resistance increases with the transition to a laminar air flow were obtained. A decrease in the processing rate from 5 to 1.2 m/min leads to the production of a material the filtration resistance of which approaches the filtration resistance of the original fabric.;"[Nazarov, V.

The authors note that children with diabetes have some disorders of the immune system, which, combined with high glycemia, increase the risk of infections and their severity, and they should be immediately detected and treated. Infections, even typical childhood diseases, significantly interfere with glycemic control. As a result of the infectious process, the level of counter-regulating hormones, cortisol, adrenaline and growth hormone increases, which leads to increased neoglycogenesis, glycogenesis and increased insulin resistance. This increase in insulin resistance requires adjustment of the patient's usual insulin dose, both basal and bolus. There are usually several hours or days before such a need arises, and it may take time to increase the dose, which can lead to hyperglycemia during this period. The presence of an infectious condition, in turn, increases blood glucose levels and increases the risk of decompensation, so pediatricians should be warned against the need to strengthen monitoring and insulin therapy. Patients with diabetes are often not fully vaccinated against various diseases.

The values of friction at die-work interface, Taylor-Quinney coefficient and interface heat transfer coefficient (IHTC) are estimated using the inverse method with the help of finite element method (FEM) and experiments on a cylindrical specimen. These values are used to predict the temperature distributions during forging of workpieces of different geometries i.e., hollow cylinder and frustum of cone specimens. Taylor-Quinney coefficient may differ considerably depending on the material and processing condition.

This is due to the fact that these injuries usually affect several structures of the oral cavity and face, including hard and soft tissues, often causing malocclusion. Thus, the clinical picture and the appropriate treatment strategy may vary greatly from one person to another.

The Delta E effect of 9.1%, large magnetostriction of 144 ppm, magnetostriction sensitivity of 0.28 ppm/Oe, Delta G effect of 5.4%, and magneto-mechanical coupling of 29.74% reached for Fe79.9Al20Tb0.1 alloy are beneficial for applications. The increased magnetostriction with increasing the Tb content x from 0 to 0.1 is related to the increased degree of (110) texture with Tb doping. Notably, the increased magnetostriction sensitivity, resulted from the increased magnetostriction with Tb-doping, leads to the enhancement of Delta E and Delta G effects. Nevertheless, the degraded (110) texture for higher Tb content (x = 0.15) results in the reduction of magneto-mechanical properties. Summarized with the experimental measured and theoretically estimated results, the micro eddy-current mechanism mainly governs the change of damping capacity with H for frequency of vibrations similar to 2.0 kHz resulting from the magnetic domain wall motion. Moreover, the amplitude and temperature dependences of internal friction and elastic modulus data, measured by DMA, including damping capacity and Young's modulus, at a frequency of 0.1-30 Hz could characterize hysteretic damping and anelastic effects at heating. The result of this study suggests a cost-effective and simple method to obtain Fe80Al20 based alloy with excellent magneto-mechanical properties via proper Tb-doping. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

The as-cast alloy consists of similar to 70% Fe13Ga9 intermetallic and similar to 30% bcc-based disordered A2 solid solution (or its partially ordered/short-range ordered B2 variant). The research proves that during the first heating of the cast alloy, the Fe13Ga9 phase is stable up to T approximate to 550 degrees C, then it transforms into alpha-Fe6Ga5, fcc-based L1(2) and B2 phases. At the same temperature, the disorder-order transition A2 -> B2 begins, ending at T approximate to 720 degrees C. The Fe13Ga9 phase does not restore during subsequent cooling and next heating and cooling cycles. The structural parameters of the identified phases are refined. The research also shows that the transition temperatures depend on the alloy prehistory. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;"[Vershinina, T. N.; Bobrikov, I.

It has a significant influence on the situation in related industries. Therefore, the current state analysis of ferrous metallurgy production and its formation based on the short-term technological forecast is essential. Based on the foregoing, the research was aimed at analyzing the current state of ferrous metallurgy production in Russia and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the prospects for industry development in the short term. The research studies the state of the ferrous metallurgy production in Russia and abroad before the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the volume of industrial production in ferrous metallurgy and the industry structure. The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered a serious global recession, necessitating an analysis of the forecast for the development of the ferrous metallurgy industry.

Having carried out an analytical analysis of the complex of sources, literature, and historical concepts at the research disposal, we made an attempt to systematically study the influence of cordon fortifications and fortresses in the Eastern Caucasus on the military-political subordination of the region during the Caucasian War. In addition, we are making an attempt to classify the methods of military and political subordination. The study attempts to reveal the role and significance of the fortifications of the Left Wing of the Caucasian Cordon Line in the subordination of the territory of the Eastern Caucasus to the Russian Empire in the 19th century, as well as to show the evolution of the regional management system during the Caucasian War. The topic of the history of the creation of cordon lines in the Eastern Caucasus, the goals and objectives of their construction is poorly covered in the scientific literature. To achieve the designated research goals and objectives, the use of the value approach was of great importance. This approach allowed not only to develop a certain attitude and assess the processes under study, but also contributed to the franking of historical events, using such scientific categories as place, role, meaning, experience. Cordon fortifications and fortresses were the conductors of the Caucasian policy in the Russian Empire in the Eastern Caucasus. Until the 30s of the XIX century, the tsarist administration of the Russian Empire mainly used the tactics of military conquest of territories by means of punitive operations to subjugate the territories of the Eastern Caucasus. The harsh methods of military subordination were gradually replaced by methods of political control, the dissemination of Russian legislation and orders. It is worth talking about political development only in those territories that were initially subordinated by force of arms, and only after a lapse of time, by means of acculturation, everyday communication and trade and economic contacts, did they become mentally closer to Russia. On the border territories, to the cordon Lines, colonization was actively carried out, first military, then civil, which also contributed to the military-political subordination of the region. The personal factor was of great importance in matters of military-political subordination of the Eastern Caucasus, the managers changed, transformed the internal vector of the Caucasian policy, changing it depending on their ideas about the conquest of the region. During the 19th century, the tactics of military subordination of the region began to evolve and transform into the military-political development of the region, with the predominant use of military resources, which was due to the ongoing Caucasian war.;"[Vagabov, Machach M.; Rogozhkin, Vasily A.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Moscow, Russia; [Gazieva, Abidat A.] Russian Acad Sci, Dagestan Fed Res Ctr, Inst Hist Archeol Ethnog, Moscow, Russia";"Moscow Polytechnic University; Russian Academy of Sciences; Dagestan Scientific Center of the Russian Academy of Sciences; Institute of History, Archaeology & Ethnography, Dagestan Scientific Center of Russian Academy of Sciences";Gazieva, AA (автор для корреспонденции), Russian Acad Sci, Dagestan Fed Res Ctr, Inst Hist Archeol Ethnog, Moscow, Russia.;gazieva.abidat@mail.ru;"Vagabov, Makhach/ABE-8346-2021; Рогожкин, Василий Алекскквич/ABE-7832-2021; Gazieva, Abidat/HFZ-8401-2022";"Vagabov, Makhach/0000-0002-6949-9490; Рогожкин, Василий Алекскквич/0000-0001-9146-2216; Gazieva, Abidat/0000-0002-8109-2861";;;;;11;0;0;0;0;INT NETWORK CENTER FUNDAMENTAL & APPLIED RESEARCH, USA;BRATISLAVA;1367-4, STARA VAJNORSKA STR, NOVE MESTO, BRATISLAVA, 831 04, SLOVAKIA;2073-9745;;;BYLYE GODY;Bylye Gody;SEP 1;2021;16;3;;;;;1162;1170;;10.13187/bg.2021.3.1162;http://dx.doi.org/10.13187/bg.2021.3.1162;;;9;History;Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI);History;UP4WU;;gold;;;2023-12-25;WOS:000695383200012;View Full Record in Web of Science

Based on the morphological analysis of the samples, the numerical value of the sample's porosity was determined. The mechanical properties of the samples were determined by static and dynamic loading methods. The values of static and dynamic elastic moduli of the samples were experimentally measured. The research results showed that, for the material under consideration, at the initial stages of compression processes, the processes of elastic deformation are mainly realized with the subsequent transition to the region of plastic deformation. It was also found that for highly porous samples in the elastic deformation region, the manifestation of pressing processes is possible. In this work, the study of the dependence of the dynamic modulus of porous diatomite ceramics on porosity was carried out: a decrease in elastic moduli was recorded with an increase in the material porosity. A decrease in material porosity after deformation is found.;"[Skvortsov, Arkadiy A.; Luk'yanov, Mikhail N.; Chebeneva, Irina E.; Skvortsova, Anna A.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Dynam Strength Machines & Resistance Mat, 38 Bolshaya Semenovskaya Str, Moscow 107023, Russia";Moscow Polytechnic University;Skvortsov, AA (автор для корреспонденции), Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Dynam Strength Machines & Resistance Mat, 38 Bolshaya Semenovskaya Str, Moscow 107023, Russia.;skvortsov5937@murdoch.in;Skvortsov, Arkadiy/J-7606-2012;Skvortsov, Arkadiy/0000-0002-9935-951X;Ministry of Education and Science of Russia [0699-2020-0023];Ministry of Education and Science of Russia(Ministry of Education and Science, Russian Federation);The study was carried out within the framework of the project of the Ministry of Education and Science of Russia (No. FZRR-2020-0023/code 0699-2020-0023).;;21;0;0;1;7;SPRINGER;DORDRECHT;VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS;1385-3449;1573-8663;;J ELECTROCERAM;J.

It is established that the steel corrosion resistance studied increases with an increase in hydrogen sulfide content. In model environments containing hydrogen sulfide, the surface of the specimens is covered with point corrosion damage in contrast to the model hydrogen sulfide-free environment of the Samotlor field in which corrosion is uniform in nature. With an increase in medium hydrogen sulfide content the free corrosion potential for steel X60 shifts into the region of positive values from - 0.44/n.h.e/ in the model medium of the Samotlor field to + 0.35 V/n.h.e/ in the NACE medium (saturated hydrogen sulfide solution) that is caused by formation of an iron sulfide film. Polarization curves for steel X60 in the solutions indicate an accelerating effect of hydrogen sulfide on cathodic and anodic processes and confirm known data for its stimulating effect on corrosion and the nature of corrosion damage. The reduction observed in cathodic process rate in hydrogen sulfide-containing media is caused by formation of an iron sulfide film that reduces the electrode active surface.;"[Guzenkova, A.

We proposed an algorithm and developed a system for the rapid detection of damaged tubers. The system can be installed on a conveyor belt in a vegetable store, and it consists of a laptop computer and an action camera, synchronized with a flashlight system. The algorithm consists of two phases. The first phase uses the Viola-Jones algorithm, applied to the filtered action camera image, so it aims to detect separate potato tubers on the conveyor belt. The second phase is the application of a method that we choose based on video capturing conditions. To isolate potatoes infected with certain types of diseases (dry rot, for example), we use the Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT)-Support Vector Machine (SVM) method. In case of inconsistent or weak lighting, the histogram of oriented gradients (HOG)-Bag-of-Visual-Words (BOVW)-neural network (BPNN) method is used. Otherwise, Otsu's threshold binarization-a convolutional neural network (CNN) method is used. The first phase's result depends on the conveyor's speed, the density of tubers on the conveyor, and the accuracy of the video system. With the optimal setting, the result reaches 97%. The second phase's outcome depends on the method and varies from 80% to 97%. When evaluating the performance of the system, it was found that it allows to detect and classify up to 100 tubers in one second, which significantly exceeds the performance of most similar systems.;"[Korchagin, Sergey Alekseevich; Gataullin, Sergey Timurovich; Osipov, Aleksey Viktorovich; Smirnov, Mikhail Viktorovich] Financial Univ Govt Russian Federat, Fed State Budgetary Inst Higher Educ, Dept Data Anal & Machine Learning, Moscow 105187, Russia; [Suvorov, Stanislav Vadimovich] Moscow Polytech Univ, Fed State Autonomous Educ Inst Higher Educ, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Serdechnyi, Denis Vladimirovich] State Univ Management, Fed State Budgetary Educ Inst Higher Educ, Moscow 109542, Russia; [Bublikov, Konstantin Vladimirovich] Slovak Acad Sci, Inst Elect Engn, Researcher, Dubravska Cesta 3484-4, Bratislava 84104, Slovakia";"Financial University Under the Government of Russian Federation; Moscow Polytechnic University; State University of Management; Slovak Academy of Sciences; Institute of Electrical Engineering, SAS";Korchagin, SA (автор для корреспонденции), Financial Univ Govt Russian Federat, Fed State Budgetary Inst Higher Educ, Dept Data Anal & Machine Learning, Moscow 105187, Russia.;"ssw1168@mail.ru; dv_serdechnyj@guu.ru; elecbubl@savba.sk";"Suvorov, Stanislav/AFR-6953-2022; Bublikov, Konstantin/GON-8125-2022; Korchagin, Sergey/AAN-4209-2020; Osipov, Aleksey/AAB-5151-2022; Suvorov, Stanislav/AFR-2542-2022; Gataullin, Sergey/AAX-8389-2021; Serdechnyy, Denis/ABD-8295-2021";"Korchagin, Sergey/0000-0001-8042-4089; Osipov, Aleksey/0000-0002-1261-8559; Suvorov, Stanislav/0000-0002-4931-1155; Gataullin, Sergey/0000-0002-0446-0552; Serdechnyy, Denis/0000-0003-3060-9469";;;;;65;9;9;5;25;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;2073-4395;;AGRONOMY-BASEL;Agronomy-Basel;OCT;2021;11;10;;;;;;;1980;10.3390/agronomy11101980;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy11101980;;;18;"Agronomy; Plant Sciences";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Agriculture; Plant Sciences";WP0CK;;gold;;;2023-12-25;WOS:000712810500001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Zenkina, Elena; Egorov, Vladimir G.";;;Metrics for Assessing the Effect of Household Income and the Money Supply on Inflation;MONTENEGRIN JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS;;;English;Article;;;;;;"Inflation; household income; money supply; economic growth; velocity of money; world economy";;High inflation remains a key outstanding issue today. It is one of the central issues facing the national economy of just about any country around the world. Inflation is known to have a particularly negative effect on the economy of developing nations. Among the key effects of high inflation are slowing economic growth, declining real household income, growing socioeconomic inequality in society, growing poverty and social tension in the country, and declining living standards and quality of life. The two key theories on the causes of inflation in the economy - the quantity (monetary) and institutional theories of inflation - lack consensus over how household income and the money supply influence inflation. To help resolve this issue, the authors suggest using the following two metrics: a coefficient for the elasticity of inflation with respect to household income and a coefficient for the elasticity of inflation with respect to the money supply. The use of these two metrics can help forecast the dynamics of inflation, depending on the dynamics of household income and the money supply in the national economy. Thus, the subject of this study is special metrics for assessing the effect of household income and the money supply on inflation. The object of this study is to explore the dependence of inflation on household income and the money supply via the use of special coefficients for the elasticity of inflation with respect to household income and the money supply. The authors' hypothesis is that growth in household income and the money supply will influence inflation in different national economies differently. In rich and developed economies, quick growth in household income and the money supply (a high degree of monetization of the economy) will have a smaller effect on inflation than in poor and developing ones. In developing economies, due to a high elasticity of inflation with respect to household income and the money supply, the inflationary process is more precipitate and intense, with significant damage inflicted on the national economy as a result. The re-search carried out by the authors confirms this hypothesis. The aut-hors investigated the dependence of inflation on household income and the money supply using their coefficients for the elasticity of inflation with respect to household income and the money supply. Ba-sed on their calculations, the authors drew the following conclusion: in rich countries (i.e., nations with high and fast-growing household income and a high level of monetization of the economy), the elasticity of inflation with respect to household income and the money supply will be lower than in poor countries (i.e., nations with low household income and a low level of monetization of the economy). For this reason, poor countries tend to suffer more from inflation, as in the event of growth in income and as a result of unsecured money issuance all the funding obtained will be used to meet current ne-eds, which will result in an immediate, quick increase in prices, ie. high levels of inflation. The proposed coefficients for the elasticity of inflation with respect to household income and the money supply can help forecast the proneness of national economies to inflation when there is growth in household income and the money supply as a result of the government pursuing a policy of cheap money to stimulate the economy.;"[Alexandrov, Dmitry G.] Russian State Univ Oil & Gas, Natl Res Univ, Moscow, Russia; [Valinurova, Liliya S.] Bashkir State Univ, Ufa, Russia; [Kostromin, Petr A.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Moscow, Russia; [V.

This necessitates an immediate understanding of the importance of cooling rate in the formation of alloy metastable and equilibrium structures. In this paper, we experimentally studied the structure of the Fe-(23-24) Ga alloys after both (i) cooling with different cooling rates and (ii) isothermal annealing between 300 and 575 degrees C up to 1800 h to report the alloy structure and present the Time Temperature-Transformation (TTT) diagrams for the metastable to equilibrium transition in these alloys. The critical cooling rates were defined with respect to the formation of the equilibrium state. A theoretical model along with corresponding Monte Carlo simulations for modeling phase transitions and construction of TTT diagram for the same alloys were developed: simulated phase diagrams were analyzed with respect to our the experimental findings.

This paper investigates the influence of the concrete mix composition on the strength of concrete. Firstly, typical risks that can occur on the composition design stage have been identified through the experts' interviews. Secondly, this risks were associated with indicators and characteristics that can be tested experimentally. Running of several mathematical models has allowed to outline concrete mix parameters of highest importance and formulate an empirical equation for the dependence of the strength of the concrete mixture on the values of the coarse aggregate quality factor, the fine aggregate fraction and the consumption of the Portland cement has been proposed. As a result, a methodology for controlling the quality of concrete at the stage of the composition design has been formulated.;"[Lisienkova, Liubov] Moscow State Univ Civil Engn, 26 Yaroslayskoye Shosse, Moscow 129337, Russia; [Shindina, Tatiana] Natl Res Univ, Moscow Power Engn Inst, 14 Krasnokazarmennaya St, Moscow 111250, Russia; [Orlova, Nina] South Ural State Univ, 76 Lenin Ave, Chelyabinsk 454080, Russia; [Komarova, Liudmila] Moscow Polytech Univ, 38 Bolshaya Semyonovskaya St, Moscow 107023, Russia";"Moscow State University of Civil Engineering; Moscow Power Engineering Institute; South Ural State University; Moscow Polytechnic University";Lisienkova, L (автор для корреспонденции), Moscow State Univ Civil Engn, 26 Yaroslayskoye Shosse, Moscow 129337, Russia.;lisienkovaln@mail.ru;"; Lisienkova, Lubov/A-3694-2016";"Shindina, Tatyana/0000-0003-0716-780X; Komarova, Ludmila/0000-0003-3005-6411; Lisienkova, Lubov/0000-0003-0897-3387";;;;;26;0;0;0;6;C EJ PUBLISHING GROUP;TEHRAN;DR KAVIANPOUR OFF, 3RD FL CIVIL ENGINEERING FAC, K N TOOSI UNIV TECHNOLOGY, TEHRAN, 00000, IRAN;2676-6957;2476-3055;;CIV ENG J-TEHRAN;Civ.

For many centuries, mankind has been using the sources of healing waters. Mineral water is used for both treatment and prophylaxis. Moreover, its healing properties were manifested with widespread use. Already starting from the XV century BC Indian Vedas gave an idea of the unique properties of mineral waters. Water from mineral and fresh sources was used for hygiene and healing purposes in the Ancient World, in particular in Egypt, Babylon, Assyria. It should be noted that groundwater has always been highly appreciated. The research is caused by the need for a comprehensive study of the Nizhne-Karmadon field to replenish mineral water reserves in the Russian Federation. The main aim of the research is the comprehensive analysis of chemical composition of mineral waters of the Nizhne-Karmadon deposit and determining the physicochemical and medicinal properties of the mineral waters of the deposit. Objects: mineral waters of the Genaldon gorge, Nizhne-Karmadon deposit, Kazbek-Dzhimarai massif. Methods: structural-tectonic method, analogy method, modeling method, geophysical methods -thermal logging of wells, facies analysis method, geomorphological method, subsoil geometrization method. The geothermal conditions of the subsoil area were assessed by measuring the water temperature at the wellheads. Results. According to the studies carried out, according to GOST R 54316-2011 and The main criteria for the chemical composition of mineral waters, the waters of the deposit are low and medium mineralized, sodium chloride, boric, high thermal. In terms of physical, chemical and medicinal properties, the mineral waters of the subsoil area of LLC Ariana are recommended for medicinal and drinking purposes in accordance with the attached medical indications.

In the pre-pandemic decade, there was a growing body of literature on media convergence in emerging markets confirming that this concept is growing in importance as a strategic path of conventional media transformation. Still, the research on the Russian conventional media transformation is scarce, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic risks on Russian print media and their business models have not been investigated so far. To fill the gap, we combined desk research, processing of published industry statistics, and data obtained by means of expert interviews. The results confirm that in the first decades of the 21st century Russian print media paid less attention to the opportunities of media convergence than Western ones. At the same time, those Russian conventional media that set ambitious goals for their future considered the adoption of the media convergence approach as crucial, even before the pandemic. The findings show the lack of systemic measures to improve the overall situation on the national media market that faces difficult times, and the need to take into account pandemic risks in the print media management activities.;"[Sheresheva, Marina] Lomonosov Moscow State Univ, Dept Econ, Moscow 119991, Russia; [Skakovskaya, Lyudmila; Bryzgalova, Elena] Tver State Univ, Dept Journalism Advertising & Publ Relat, Zhelyabov Str 33, Tver 170100, Russia; [Antonov-Ovseenko, Anton] Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Publishing & Bibliol, Moscow 115280, Russia; [Shitikova, Helen] Publishing Advertising Alliance Ltd, Publishing Dept, Tverskaya Str 20,Bld 3, Moscow 125009, Russia";"Lomonosov Moscow State University; Tver State University; Moscow Polytechnic University";Sheresheva, M (автор для корреспонденции), Lomonosov Moscow State Univ, Dept Econ, Moscow 119991, Russia.;"m.sheresheva@gmail.com; education@tversu.ru; bryzgalovaelena@gmail.com; anton.antonov.ovseenko@gmail.com; helen-shitikova@yandex.ru";"Антонов-Овсеенко, Антон Антонович/AAV-1154-2020; Sheresheva, Marina/AAH-4719-2021; Shitikova, Elena M./AAY-2749-2021";"Sheresheva, Marina/0000-0002-8153-7111; Antonov-Ovseenko, Anton/0000-0002-2486-5936";;;;;77;1;1;2;26;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;1911-8066;1911-8074;;J RISK FINANC MANAG;J.

The materials of the works of modern researchers and the numerical calculations carried out made it possible to trace the differences between reactive power and distortion power, to confirm the orthogonality properties of the active, reactive power, and distortion power components. The paper defines the conditions for achieving a power balance in an AC network with nonlinear loads, compiled and tested criteria leading to the absence of distortion power in a single-phase AC network. Using the time base of the projection of the generalized vectors in vector diagrams, it is shown that compliance with the criteria for the absence of distortion power does not determine the mutual similarity of the voltage curve with the current curve for a nonlinear load. It has been found that the well-known term distortion power has an unfortunate wording, since this power, although it characterizes the interaction of harmonics of currents and voltages with different ordinal numbers, is not determined by the visual similarity or the degree of distortion of the load current waveforms relative to the supply voltage curve.;"[Shchurov, Nickolay, I; Myatezh, Sergey, V; Malozyomov, Boris, V; Shtang, Alexander A.; Dedov, Sergei, I] Novosibirsk State Tech Univ, Fac Mechatron & Automat, 20 Karla Marksa Ave, Novosibirsk 630073, Russia; [Martyushev, Nikita, V] Tomsk Polytech Univ, Dept Mat Sci, 30 Lenina Ave, Tomsk 634050, Russia; [Klyuev, Roman, V] Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Low Temp Engn, 33 B Semenovskaya Str, Moscow 107023, Russia";"Novosibirsk State Technical University; Tomsk Polytechnic University; Moscow Polytechnic University";Malozyomov, BV (автор для корреспонденции), Novosibirsk State Tech Univ, Fac Mechatron & Automat, 20 Karla Marksa Ave, Novosibirsk 630073, Russia.;"nischurov@mail.ru; serg_y_7578@mail.ru; borisnovel@mail.ru; shtang@corp.nstu.ru; martjushev@tpu.ru; kluev-roman@ramler.ru; dedov_s.i@mail.ru";"Martyushev, Nikita/K-1714-2013; Malozyomov, Boris V./J-1723-2016; Klyuev, Roman Vladimirovich/AAX-6549-2021; Shtang, Alexandr A/I-8210-2016; Martyushev, Nikita/AAO-2653-2020; Klyuev, Roman/J-8000-2014; Schurov, Nikolay I/A-4590-2016";"Martyushev, Nikita/0000-0003-0620-9561; Malozyomov, Boris V./0000-0001-8686-9556; Klyuev, Roman Vladimirovich/0000-0003-3777-7203; Martyushev, Nikita/0000-0003-0620-9561; Klyuev, Roman/0000-0003-3777-7203; Schurov, Nikolay I/0000-0003-2598-0351";"NSTU development program; TPU development program";"NSTU development program; TPU development program";This research was supported by the NSTU development program.

Under the same quenching conditions, additional alpha-Mn phase with A12 structure in the Mn-10Cu-4Cr alloy is observed as compared with Mn-13Cu alloy at room temperature (RT). The replacement of Cu atoms by Cr atoms retards the spinodal decomposition of austenite during ageing compared to the binary Mn-13Cu alloy according to SANS and Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) results. The reason is that Cr enriches in the alpha-Mn phase, and thus its addition leads to the formation of the alpha-Mn phase. Compared to the Mn-13Cu alloy, there is an increase in the tetragonality of the face-centered tetragonal (f.c.t.) martensite, which may be attributed to changes in magnetic interaction owing to partial substitution of Cu by Cr. The higher tetragonality value leads to a higher volume effect during martensitic transition (MT) of Mn-10Cu-4Cr alloy than that of Mn-13Cu alloy (around 1.5 times). The lattice parameters of the f.c.t.-martensite do not converge exactly to the parameter of the f.c.c.-austenite at the MT temperature due to replacement of Cu by Cr. Instead, there is a jump of the lattice parameters during phase transition. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.;"[Sun, Liying; Vasin, R. N.; Bobrikov, I. A.; Sumnikov, S. V.; Balagurov, A.

However, the acquisition of these benefits does not negate the complexity of making a decision whether or not to implement a particular IT project. The total cost of ownership of the information system throughout the life cycle is usually not considered in comparison with the expected benefits from the use of the system, due to the uncertainty of such benefits. Comparative certainty of approaches and methods is present only in terms of costs, both for a priori (planned) and a posteriori (actual) assessment. It is possible to determine both capital and operating costs accurately enough. Indirect definition of the positive influence of an information system on the activity of the organization also seems possible. However, there are currently no generally recognized methods for analyzing the expected positive effect of an IT project. At the same time, large companies, in accordance with the requirements of the respective regulators and / or due to internal management considerations, build a risk management system to determine the level of capabilities, losses and to prevent adverse events. This study considers the feasibility of an approach to analyze the effectiveness of the implementation of the information system on the basis of the company's risk reduction, leading to a decrease in economic benefits.

To this end, 60 EFL learners out of one-hundred were selected through the administration of an Oxford Placement Test from three language institutes and divided into 3 groups (two experimental and one control group) each including 20 intermediate EFL learners. The first experimental group received teacher-scaffolding instruction, the second experimental group received peer-scaffolding instruction and the control group received traditional instruction with no scaffolding. The vocabulary and reading comprehension pre-tests were administered to the three groups. At the end of the experiment, the vocabulary and reading comprehension post-tests were administered. The descriptive statistics (mean and standard deviation) and the inferential statistics (a One-way ANOVA) were run to analyze the collected data. The results showed that both experimental groups had better performance than the control group and there was a significant difference between teacher-scaffolding and peer-scaffolding in both vocabulary knowledge and reading comprehension performance and the peer-scaffolding group had a better performance than the teacher-scaffolding group.

A brief description of the MPP is given, the power supply and substitution circuits used to calculate the short-circuit currents are given. A statistical analysis of failures in the electric network of the MPP has been carried out, which makes it possible to draw conclusions about the nature of failures ranges. Analysis of the registered faults shows that a significant part of them are line-to-earth faults, which in most cases turn into multiphase short circuits, which are interrupted by overcurrent protection. In order to improve the efficiency and reliability of the relay protection, the power supply scheme of the MPP was refined and analyzed. The calculation of the short-circuit currents was made, which made it possible to calculate the settings of the relay protection and give recommendations on the place of its installation and adjustment in order to ensure the normal operation of electricity consumers. To reduce the number of failures to the cable insert on the line leaving the administrative and household complex (AHC), and to increase the reliability of power supply to consumers, it is advisable to divide the capacities of the existing 10 kV line into two parallel ones by laying a second line. It is recommended to install a current cut-off on the line outgoing to the AHC, the feasibility of the installation of which was shown by calculations. This will reduce the chance of failures to the cable gland. Data on the setting currents of overcurrent protection and current cut-off are given on the selectivity card.;"[Klyuev, Roman, V] Moscow Polytech Univ, Moscow, Russia; [Bosikov, Igor I.; Gavrina, Oksana A.] State Technol Univ, North Caucasian Min & Met Inst, Vladikavkaz, Russia";"Moscow Polytechnic University; North Caucasian Institute of Mining & Metallurgy (State Technological University)";Klyuev, RV (автор для корреспонденции), Moscow Polytech Univ, Moscow, Russia.;"kluev-roman@rambler.ru; igor.boss.777@mail.ru; Gavrina-Oksana@yandex.ru";"Gavrina, Oksana/HMP-7136-2023; Klyuev, Roman Vladimirovich/AAX-6549-2021; Klyuev, Roman/J-8000-2014";"Klyuev, Roman Vladimirovich/0000-0003-3777-7203; Klyuev, Roman/0000-0003-3777-7203; Gavrina, Oksana/0000-0002-9712-9075";;;;;23;3;3;0;1;SAINT-PETERSBURG MINING UNIV;SANKT-PETERSBURG;SAINT-PETERSBURG MINING UNIV, SANKT-PETERSBURG, 00000, RUSSIA;2411-3336;2541-9404;;J MIN INST;J.

The characteristics of the power supply system and starting of the main motors with a voltage of 6 kV are given. In order to determine the time of the complete start-up of the units and the self-start conditions determined by the run-out time, experimental studies of start-up and run-out were carried out. In the course of experimental studies, the acceleration and run-down curves were obtained. The analysis of the characteristics of starting, coasting and protection of motors shows that the run-out time of the machines under study is several times longer than the possible time of entering the power reserve, both at the shop substations and at the main step-down substation. Therefore, the residual speed of rotation of the units during coasting and the holding time of automatic transfer of the reserve from 0.5 to 1.5 s will not be lower than 0.9 of the nominal, which will reduce the multiplicity of the starting current by 3-4 times and facilitate the conditions for self-starting. The calculation of the conditions for self-starting of motors with a voltage of 6 kV and recommendations for setting up protection. The calculation of self-starting is performed according to the well-known method for determining the relative voltage during self-starting and the corresponding torque and moment of resistance. The possibility of self-starting of electric motors has been checked. It has been established that in order to solve the problems of self-starting of motors with a voltage of 6 kV in conditions of a complex power supply scheme and conditions of start-up and run-down, which are difficult for technological reasons, it is necessary to study these conditions in order to identify their influence on self-starting.;"[Chedzhemov, S.

Design/methodology/approach The study outlines that the information technology use, in particular, highly specialized supply chain management (SCM) software, is necessary for the effective functioning of global supply chains (GSCs). For the purposes of the one-factor regression models of the relationship between the signs for the analyzed factors, volume of external cargo transportation, volume of internal cargo transportation and amount of investment in SCM software were built, and the correlation coefficients were also determined. The research was based on data of the Russian Federation, China and Germany. Findings According to the results, for local cargo transportation for all three counties (Russian Federation: R-2 = 0.3679, China: R-2 = 0.441, Germany: 0.441), the correlation coefficients indicated no connection between the factors under study, while for external ones, they denoted a strong direct relationship: Russian Federation: R-2 = 0.906, China: R-2 = 0.8692, Germany: 0.926. It is statistically confirmed that external transportations are carried out by enterprises involved in GSCs, while the local ones are mainly performed by the domestic market-oriented companies. Originality/value The study presents a model for the formation of economic mechanisms of SCM from the perspective of a systemic approach. It allows for structural analysis of the SCM strategy's impact on the functioning of participants within three management levels (corporate, business and functional). The study contributes to the practical domain of SCM: the results of the study can be applied by top managers of companies in developing SCM strategies, as well as by officials in developing and implementing governmental supply chain-related policies. In terms of scientific contribution, the research can also be of use: its methods and results can be applied by scientists in researching approaches to the economic mechanisms formation for managing supply chains on export and import volumes, as well as local cargo transportation in various countries and regions.;"[Saenko, Natalya] Moscow Polytech Univ, Moscow, Russia; [Nyanga Gakosso, Chancelvie] Peoples Friendship Univ Russia, Dept Natl Econ, Moscow, Russia; [Mezhlumyan, Nelli] Transbaikal State Univ, Chita, Russia; [Smirnov, Artem] St Petersburg State Univ, St Petersburg, Russia; [Rogulin, Rodion] Far Eastern Fed Univ FEFU, Vladivostok, Russia; [Rogulin, Rodion] Vladivostok State Univ Econ & Serv VVSU, Vladivostok, Russia";"Moscow Polytechnic University; Peoples Friendship University of Russia; Transbaikal State University; Saint Petersburg State University; Far Eastern Federal University";Saenko, N (автор для корреспонденции), Moscow Polytech Univ, Moscow, Russia.;"saenko_nat425@rambler.ru; chngakosso@rambler.ru; mezhlumyan.n@rambler.ru; smirnov9696@rambler.ru; rogulin_rd@rambler.ru";Saenko, Natalya Ryafikovna/AAQ-5703-2020;;"DAAD (German Academic Exchange Service); Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation within the framework of the Immanuel Kant program";"DAAD (German Academic Exchange Service)(Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD)); Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation within the framework of the Immanuel Kant program";Rodion Rogulin was supported by the DAAD (German Academic Exchange Service) and the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation within the framework of the Immanuel Kant program.;;43;0;0;0;6;EMERALD GROUP PUBLISHING LTD;BINGLEY;HOWARD HOUSE, WAGON LANE, BINGLEY BD16 1WA, W YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND;1463-6689;1465-9832;;FORESIGHT;Foresight;AUG 10;2021;23;5;;;;;583;596;;10.1108/FS-10-2020-0111;http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/FS-10-2020-0111;;JUN 2021;14;Regional & Urban Planning;Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI);Public Administration;TY6KC;;;;;2023-12-25;WOS:000669438800001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Cast iron is one of the most common materials used in various industrial sectors. Cast iron scrap processing is the least expensive and saves both money and time. It is produced both in Russia and abroad and is one of the export types. Cast iron production significantly influences other industrial sectors. All this confirms the relevance of the study. The novelty of the study consists in the identification of the leaders among the cast-iron producers in the world and Russian metallurgical companies, as well as the determination of trends in its production at the present stage of economic development. The increasing consolidation level of cast iron producers has been revealed: China, India, Japan, and Russia represented 85% of the cast iron global production in 2019. In Russia, nine metallurgical companies account for 80% of cast iron production. In general, cast iron production in the world is stable and the import share of cast iron is about 4%. Cast iron prices tend to decline. The work identifies the lower and upper limits of the possible range of the cast iron prices. The authors conclude that the declining prices of cast iron in Russia may make its production unprofitable.;"[Golubev, S. S.; Sekerin, V. D.; Gorokhova, A.

The hardness distribution in the joints has a W-shape characteristic of these alloys. Artificial aging after welding is shown to cause an increase in the strength coefficient of the joints to 0.92-0.96 at a bending angle of 160 degrees-170 degrees. Complete heat treatment, including quenching and artificial aging, is found to cause noticeable buckling of the welded joints and to be accompanied by a decrease in the strength and plastic properties of the joints because of grain growth in the mixing and thermomechanical action zones. After this treatment, the microhardness distribution within the welded joints is found to decrease and level off.;"[Ovchinnikov, V. V.; Kurbatova, I. A.; Fedorov, A. O.; Romanenko, S.

The scanning radiation is formed by modulating single-frequency tunable radiation on dual-port Mach-Zehnder modulators to scan both dual-frequency and three-frequency signals.

Here, arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) finite element method (FEM)-based numerical simulations are carried out for the forging of aluminium workpiece by considering two friction models - Coulomb-Siebel and Tresca. A relation between Coulomb's coefficient of friction and friction factor has been established based on the slab method. The forging load is obtained by calculating the reaction force on the die as well as from energy method. Energy method provides more accurate and consistent results. Forging load and bulge increase with the friction, but at high friction, the effect is minimal. Bulge is found to be more sensitive to friction than the forging load. The distribution of normal stress is quite different on the die-workpiece interface compared to that on a parallel plane in the interior. The phenomenon of fold-over observed at high friction and high reduction observed in a Lagrangian formulation is absent in ALE formulation. The fold-over phenomenon occurs due to mesh distortion. It is not observed in a workpiece with round corners, even while using Lagrangian formulation.";"[Dixit, Uday S.; Raj, Amit] Indian Inst Technol Guwahati, Dept Mech Engn, Gauhati, India; [Petrov, Pavel A.; Matveev, Alexey G.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Mat Forming & Addit Technol, Moscow, Russia";"Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) - Guwahati; Moscow Polytechnic University";Dixit, US (автор для корреспонденции), Indian Inst Technol Guwahati, Dept Mech Engn, Gauhati, India.;uday@iitg.ac.in;"Petrov, Pavel/ITV-6650-2023; Petrov, Pavel/A-8443-2011; Raj, Amit/JAC-2259-2023";"Petrov, Pavel/0000-0001-5541-5690; Petrov, Pavel/0000-0001-5541-5690; Raj, Amit/0000-0002-5337-2057; Dixit, Uday/0000-0001-7325-1618";"Department of Science and Technology India [INT/RUS/RFBR/388]; Russian Foundation for Basic Research [19-58-45020\19]";"Department of Science and Technology India(Department of Science & Technology (India)); Russian Foundation for Basic Research(Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR)Spanish Government)";"This work was supported by the Department of Science and Technology India [INT/RUS/RFBR/388]; Russian Foundation for Basic Research [19-58-45020\19].";;41;3;3;2;8;TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;2374-068X;2374-0698;;ADV MATER PROCESS TE;Adv.

The question of homework occupies one of the main places in educational activities since this question is directly related to the health of the child. A competent approach to minimizing the time for completing homework, taking into account the maximum efficiency obtained from the learning process, can preserve the health of students to some extent. The article describes a method for obtaining the most comfortable results of the process of completing homework, which are a Pareto set. This method is implemented using a genetic algorithm and queuing theory, and the selection of homework is carried out on the basis of intellectual analysis of the text of tasks and is a scale of a certain range. The proposed algorithm successfully obtains the solutions of the Pareto set and minimizes the efforts of school students while achieving the maximum efficiency of the educational process to preserve their health. Compared with other known algorithms, the results obtained show that the proposed algorithm demonstrates fairly accurate optimization characteristics presented in the form of a Pareto set.

Reducing emergency situations is necessary due to the autonomous operation of drilling rigs and bulk seaports in the subarctic and Arctic climate. The relevance of the topic is linked with the development of a methodology for theoretical and practical studies of gas dynamics when gas flows in a pipe, based on a mathematical model using new mathematical methods for calculation of excess speeds in case of wind gusts. Problems in the operation of offshore wind turbines arise with storm gusts of wind, which is comparable to the wave movement of the gas flow. Thus, the scientific problem of increasing the reliability of wind turbines in conditions of strong wind gusts is solved. The authors indicate a gross error in the calculations when approximating through the use of the Fourier series. The obtained results will allow us to solve one of the essential problems of modeling at this stage of its development, namely: to reduce the calculation time and the adequacy of the model built for similar installations and devices. Experimental studies of gas-dynamic flows are carried out on the example of a physical model of a wind turbine. In addition, a computer simulation of the gas-dynamic flow process was carried out.

The permeability decreased for fabrics with surface densities from 0.15 to 0.25 kg/m(2) for various roller temperatures if the treatment rate was decreased from 10 to 2-4 m/min although it began to increase if the rate was reduced further. The permeability of fabrics with surface density 0.4 kg/m(2) decreased constantly if the treatment rate at various roller temperatures was decreased. The dependence of the permeability on the structure of a modified layer of fabric in which the fibers reoriented with increasing filtration resistance during the treatment was determined from the relationship between the change of permeability and porosity of treated materials.

The article aims to study the dynamics of greenhouse gas emissions as they depend on the type and structure of economic activity in the Russian Federation (RF); to identify the impact of the pandemic and its consequences on the energy sector development and to justify the need to switch to renewable energy to ensure the sustainable economic development of Russia. Materials and Methods. In the process of conducting this study, statistical methods of analysis, system analysis method and the comparative method of analysis were used. Results. The results of the study have confirmed the need to switch to renewable energy in order to ensure the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions into the environment (each unit of energy generated by RES will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50-200 %). The reason is that the economy sector accounts for almost 79% of such emissions, which makes the transition to renewable energy relevant to ensuring the sustainable economic development of Russia. Conclusion. Achievement of the internationally recognized Sustainable Development Goals, in particular Goal 7 Ensuring Access to Affordable, Reliable, Sustainable and Modern Energy Sources for All in the context of a pandemic and its consequences necessitates energy sector reform.

Particular attention has been paid to the careful modeling of the behavior of the materials of the punch and the plate under dynamic loading. To confirm the reliability of the calculation models used, tests have been carried out by firing at real protection samples, the results of which have shown a good agreement with the data of numerical experiments. The developed models allow to offer effective protection at the design stage, as well as to assess the armor protection level of existing foreign samples.

Respectively, pair production will be followed by the release of the other particles opposite to them in a gravitational charge. This paper considered the possibility of detecting such particles and their possible influences at distant astronomical objects. Gravastar with the electron mass and bubble structure type is studied under the gravitational mass defect as a result of the presence of negative binding energy assumption.

Metallographic studies, structural characteristics, and the results of the combined fatigue test are presented. The studies found that the combined hardening technology increases rigidity, but at the same time retains its strength, reducing elastic - plastic deformation under the influence of applied stresses, and thereby reducing the propagation of cracks in the material. It has been established that the technology of hardening compressor blades by the method of combined hardening reduces the number of fracture sites, improves the quality of the surface layer and provides an increase in fatigue strength by 18-20% compared to ultrasonic hardening.

A promising direction for reducing roughness during laser hardening with reflow can be the development of a process using additives that reduce the surface tension of the melt and increase the wettability of the surface. It was revealed that phase hardening and martensitic transformation beta ->alpha are the causes of hardening of titanium during laser processing. This is confirmed by a change in the width of the x-ray lines. It was found that during laser processing with a speed of 3.7 mm/s and higher, a fine-grained structure is achieved. The results show that, at a sufficiently high cooling rate of the substrate, the grain sizes remain practically unchanged.

Early detection using medical imaging is critically important for the long-term survival of the patients. Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) tools can potentially reduce the number of incorrect interpretations of medical image data by radiologists. Datasets with adequate sample size, annotation, and truth are the dominant factors in developing and training effective CAD algorithms. The objective of this study was to produce a practical approach and a tool for the creation of medical image datasets. Methods: The proposed model uses the modified maximum transverse diameter approach to mark a putative lung nodule. The modification involves the possibility to use a set of overlapping spheres of appropriate size to approximate the shape of the nodule. The algorithm embedded in the model also groups the marks made by different readers for the same lesion. We used the data of 536 randomly selected patients of Moscow outpatient clinics to create a dataset of standard-dose chest computed tomography (CT) scans utilizing the double-reading approach with arbitration. Six volunteer radiologists independently produced a report for each scan using the proposed model with the main focus on the detection of lesions with sizes ranging from 3 to 30 mm. After this, an arbitrator reviewed their marks and annotations. Results: The maximum transverse diameter approach outperformed the alternative methods (3D box, ellipsoid, and complete outline construction) in a study of 10,0 0 0 computer-generated tumor models of different shapes in terms of accuracy and speed of nodule shape approximation. The markup and annotation of the CTLungCa-50 0 dataset revealed 72 studies containing no lung nodules. The remaining 464 CT scans contained 3151 lesions marked by at least one radiologist: 56%, 14%, and 29% of the lesions were malignant, benign, and non-nodular, respectively. 2887 lesions have the target size of 3-30 mm. Only 70 nodules were uniformly identified by all the six readers. An increase in the number of independent readers providing CT scans interpretations led to an accuracy increase associated with a decrease in agreement. The dataset markup process took three working weeks. Conclusions: The developed cluster model simplifies the collaborative and crowdsourced creation of image repositories and makes it time-efficient. Our proof-of-concept dataset provides a valuable source of annotated medical imaging data for training CAD algorithms aimed at early detection of lung nodules.

The demand for such services has increased significantly today due to the heavy workload of state medical institutions. However, today consumers choose the most high-quality services in the medical field, so the economic activity of medical commercial companies directly depends on the extent where specialists can provide patients with an individual approach and high-quality treatment. The purpose of the work is to study the efficiency of a commercial organization based on the analysis of its financial documentation. The author comes to the conclusion that the medical organization Medicon+ LLC has significantly improved its financial performance during the analyzed period. This indicates that the level of services provided, as well as their demand by the citizens, is constantly growing. The increase in the number of patient visits to specialists of the analyzed clinic is also caused by the increase in the incidence of the population due to the pandemic and the decrease in the capacity of public medical institutions in this regard. However, according to the analysis, it should be concluded that in the future, taking into account the quality of services provided and recognition, the clinic of LLC Medicon+ will be able to function effectively even after the stabilization of the epidemiological situation in the country and in the world.;"[Idrisova, Maryam Shamilevna; Ismailov, Ilyas Muslimovich] Astrakhan State Med Univ, 121 Bakinskaya St, Astrakhan 414000, Russia; [Elizarova, Nadezda Sergeevna] Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Personnel Management, Moscow, Russia; [Goncharov, Vitaly V.] Kuban State Agr Univ, Krasnodar, Russia; [Zatsarinnaya, Elena Ivanovna] Plekhanov Russian Univ Econ, Moscow, Russia; [Chumakova, Natalya Valeryevna] Don State Agr Univ, Azov Black Sea Engn Inst, Zernograd, Russia";"Astrakhan State Medical University; Moscow Polytechnic University; Kuban State Agrarian University; Plekhanov Russian University of Economics; Don State Agrarian University";Idrisova, MS (автор для корреспонденции), Astrakhan State Med Univ, 121 Bakinskaya St, Astrakhan 414000, Russia.;Idrisova.maryam@bk.ru;"Zatsarinnaya, Elena/AAJ-2172-2020; Goncharov, Vitaly Victorovich/C-4842-2017; Chumakova, Nataly/AAR-7842-2021; Mironenko (Elizarova), Nadezda/AAQ-9373-2021";"Goncharov, Vitaly Victorovich/0000-0003-3029-4727; Mironenko (Elizarova), Nadezda/0000-0002-5690-9294";;;;;12;0;0;0;4;UNIV SAN IGNACIO LOYOLA;LIMA;AVE LA FONTANA, S-N, LA MOLINA, LIMA, 00000, PERU;2307-7999;2310-4635;;PROPOS REPRESENT;Propos.

In an acidic medium with (pH 2.10) the test steel corrosion rate is faster by more than a factor of 2.5 than in a medium with pH of 6.31. In the range of pH values 6.31-4.01 steel X60 corrosion rate changes insignificantly (1.88-1.95 g/(m(2). h)). With an increase in pH from 2.10 to 6.31 steel X60 free corrosion potential moves into the region of negative values (from -0.307 to -0.416 V /n.h.e/) due to formation of sulfide porous films of complex composition fulfilling the function of cathodes in a corrosion microgalvanic element Fe-FexSy.

The aim of the research is to build a trend of global economic recovery in terms of stimulating the increase in the value of production assets and an overall assessment of the development potential of the research program. Budgeting of the process should be considered in terms of formation of the development model not only on the basis of factual assessment, but on the level of forecasted economic growth as well. In the course of the research, mainly prognostic and extrapolation methods were used basing on the actual data collected with the growing economy prior to the crisis. The main results of the study are presented in the form of a model for reducing the consequences of the liquidation of crisis phenomena. The model reflects the close relationship between the gross output of goods and services in the industrial sector during the crisis and shows the possibility of changes in the value of fixed assets and the number of people employed in the industrial sector.

The results of a morphological analysis of the samples under study were used to examine the porous structure of the ceramic (morphology and average pore diameter) and determine the numerical value of the porosity of the samples (35-50%). The static (70-115 GPa) and dynamic (37-50 GPa) elasticity moduli of the samples were experimentally determined. The dependence of the dynamic modulus of the porous diatomite ceramic on porosity was examined: the elasticity moduli were found to decrease with increasing porosity of the material. The decrease in the porosity of the material after its being deformed was also found. It was observed that diatomite threads are formed after the samples were subjected to a compression deformation at a rate not exceeding 8 x 10(-4) s(-1).;"[Skvortsov, A. A.; Luk'yanov, M.

The modeling principle is used to study the temperature field on the spark gap electrode. A mathematical model of the process is compiled on the basis of the balance of power entering the cathode spot and its removal inside the cathode due to thermal conductivity. A numerical solution of the obtained nonlinear heat equation with inhomogeneous boundary conditions by the finite-difference method is presented. The authors compared the found temperatures in the cathode spot for metals of the fourth and fifth groups of the Mendeleev's Periodic Table with the corresponding melting points of the selected metals. A complete correlation was obtained between these temperatures. Simulation of thermal processes in the region of the cathode spot on the electrode made of 42NA-VI alloy has been carried out.

Nothing can replace human contact, but we can enhance the remote aspect of learning. In our study, we use the empirical method: data collection by continuous sampling and factual activity. The theoretical research method is reflected in the subsequent modeling of the flexible trajectory in distance education. The study has found the following results. The alternating phases of distance learning, live lectures and seminars can be planned so that for the period of live communication you need to put the maximum of theory and practice on those issues that are difficult to solve in distance learning. To build effective work in an online university, an online platform is needed. When performing the same type of grammar tasks on an online platform with the aim of assimilating them and further automation, the teacher saves energy for more efficient work in the webinar. The advantages of online learning compared to traditional classes are that an absent student may later be asked to complete a task that will be automatically verified and tracked. Taking tests and exams in the online conference mode is easier, easier than it seems if you learn to use its convenient options. The psychophysics of some students is such that the pressure of the teacher in the class is not the best form of assimilation of the material. Having fine access to the task, he can complete it at the most favorable time, at the best pace for himself, to remake it. The disadvantages of the platform are that uncontrolled work on it can lead to an endless search by students for a collective answer to tasks, tasks, based on intuition and their mechanical execution. Do not overestimate the student's desire to comprehend knowledge. Control here should be even more serious than in fulltime classes. The reasons for teachers' complaints about webinars also occur for the following reasons: there was no temporary opportunity to study and even more confidently use all the features of conference applications, there was no way to connect existing developments in the field of distance and e-learning, and the advantages of mobile applications were not actively used.

The employed algorithm allows iterative removal of noise and distortions without loss in the fringe contrast as well as provides a means to determine the local path of each fringe.

In this connection, the classical results on that problems concern domains with rectifiable boundaries only. On the other hand, the boundary value problems themselves make sense for non-rectifiable boundaries, too. This is the reason for recent development of theory of generalized integration over plane non-rectifiable Jordan curves and arcs. The existence of such generalized integrations over non-rectifiable arcs depends on certain geometry properties of the arcs in neighborhoods of their ends. Here we consider the connections of generalized integration and so-called torsions of the path of integration at its end points.;"[Katz, David B.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Chair Math, Moscow, Russia; [Kats, Boris A.] Kazan Fed Univ, Math Anal, Kazan, Russia";"Moscow Polytechnic University; Kazan Federal University";Katz, DB (автор для корреспонденции), Moscow Polytech Univ, Chair Math, Moscow, Russia.;kazdavid89@gmail.com;Katz, David/Q-8689-2016;Katz, David/0000-0003-4361-9017;Scientific and Educational Mathematical Center of the Volga Federal District [075-02-2020-1478];Scientific and Educational Mathematical Center of the Volga Federal District;This work was supported as part of the development program of the Scientific and Educational Mathematical Center of the Volga Federal District, agreement No. 075-02-2020-1478.;;35;0;0;0;1;TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD;ABINGDON;2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND;1747-6933;1747-6941;;COMPLEX VAR ELLIPTIC;Complex Var.

It is shown that a set of digital holograms recorded with a scanning reference beam makes it possible to reconstruct the complex amplitude of the object field. The proposed method for registering digital holograms is considered a digital analog of Denisyuk's holography. In particular, a condition is obtained connecting the number of steps (number of holograms) with the quantity of the phase step, when the background and conjugate image are eliminated after the reconstruction procedure of an object field according to the suggested algorithm.

J;"Aksenov, AV; Polyanin, AD";;;;"Aksenov, Alexander V.; Polyanin, Andrei D.";;;Methods for Constructing Complex Solutions of Nonlinear PDEs Using Simpler Solutions;MATHEMATICS;;;English;Article;;;;;;"exact solutions; nonlinear PDEs; reaction-diffusion equations; wave type equations; PDEs with constant and variable delay; pantograph-type PDEs; functional-differential equations";;This paper describes a number of simple but quite effective methods for constructing exact solutions of nonlinear partial differential equations that involve a relatively small amount of intermediate calculations. The methods employ two main ideas: (i) simple exact solutions can serve to construct more complex solutions of the equations under consideration and (ii) exact solutions of some equations can serve to construct solutions of other, more complex equations. In particular, we propose a method for constructing complex solutions from simple solutions using translation and scaling. We show that in some cases, rather complex solutions can be obtained by adding one or more terms to simpler solutions. There are situations where nonlinear superposition allows us to construct a complex composite solution using similar simple solutions. We also propose a few methods for constructing complex exact solutions to linear and nonlinear PDEs by introducing complex-valued parameters into simpler solutions. The effectiveness of the methods is illustrated by a large number of specific examples (over 30 in total). These include nonlinear heat equations, reaction-diffusion equations, wave type equations, Klein-Gordon type equations, equations of motion through porous media, hydrodynamic boundary layer equations, equations of motion of a liquid film, equations of gas dynamics, Navier-Stokes equations, and some other PDEs. Apart from exact solutions to 'ordinary' partial differential equations, we also describe some exact solutions to more complex nonlinear delay PDEs. Along with the unknown function at the current time, u=u(x,t), these equations contain the same function at a past time, w=u(x,t-tau), where tau>0 is the delay time. Furthermore, we look at nonlinear partial functional-differential equations of the pantograph type, which, in addition to the unknown u=u(x,t), also contain the same functions with dilated or contracted arguments, w=u(px,qt), where p and q are scaling parameters. We propose an efficient approach to construct exact solutions to such functional-differential equations. Some new exact solutions of nonlinear pantograph-type PDEs are presented. The methods and examples in this paper are presented according to the principle from simple to complex.;"[Aksenov, Alexander V.] Lomonosov Moscow State Univ, Fac Mech & Math, 1 Leninskiye Gory,Main Bldg, Moscow 119234, Russia; [Aksenov, Alexander V.] Natl Res Nucl Univ MEPhI, Dept Appl Math, 31 Kashirskoe Shosse, Moscow 115409, Russia; [Aksenov, Alexander V.] RAS, Keldysh Inst Appl Math, Miusskaya Sq, Moscow 125047, Russia; [Polyanin, Andrei D.] RAS, Ishlinsky Inst Problems Mech, 101 Vernadsky Ave,Bldg 1, Moscow 119526, Russia; [Polyanin, Andrei D.] Bauman Moscow State Tech Univ, Dept Appl Math, 5 Second Baumanskaya St, Moscow 105005, Russia; [Polyanin, Andrei D.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Chem Engn & Biotechnol Dept, 38 Bolshaya Semenovskaya St, Moscow 107023, Russia";"Lomonosov Moscow State University; National Research Nuclear University MEPhI (Moscow Engineering Physics Institute); Russian Academy of Sciences; Keldysh Institute of Applied Mathematics; Russian Academy of Sciences; Ishlinsky Institute for Problems in Mechanics RAS; Bauman Moscow State Technical University; Moscow Polytechnic University";"Aksenov, AV (автор для корреспонденции), Lomonosov Moscow State Univ, Fac Mech & Math, 1 Leninskiye Gory,Main Bldg, Moscow 119234, Russia.;Aksenov, AV (автор для корреспонденции), Natl Res Nucl Univ MEPhI, Dept Appl Math, 31 Kashirskoe Shosse, Moscow 115409, Russia.;Aksenov, AV (автор для корреспонденции), RAS, Keldysh Inst Appl Math, Miusskaya Sq, Moscow 125047, Russia.;Polyanin, AD (автор для корреспонденции), RAS, Ishlinsky Inst Problems Mech, 101 Vernadsky Ave,Bldg 1, Moscow 119526, Russia.;Polyanin, AD (автор для корреспонденции), Bauman Moscow State Tech Univ, Dept Appl Math, 5 Second Baumanskaya St, Moscow 105005, Russia.;Polyanin, AD (автор для корреспонденции), Moscow Polytech Univ, Chem Engn & Biotechnol Dept, 38 Bolshaya Semenovskaya St, Moscow 107023, Russia.";"aksenov@mech.math.msu.su; polyanin@ipmnet.ru";Polyanin, Andrei D/E-5121-2015;"Polyanin, Andrei D/0000-0002-2610-0590; Aksenov, Alexander/0000-0002-7521-392X";"Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation [0723-2020-0036, AAAA-A20-120011690135-5, AAAA-A20-120092190052-9]; Russian Foundation for Basic Research [18-01-00890, 18-29-10025]";"Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation(Ministry of Education and Science, Russian Federation); Russian Foundation for Basic Research(Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR)Spanish Government)";The study was supported by the Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation within the framework of the State Assignment (registration No. 0723-2020-0036, No. AAAA-A20-120011690135-5 and No. AAAA-A20-120092190052-9) and was partially supported by the Russian Foundation for Basic Research (project No. 18-01-00890 and No. 18-29-10025).;;90;6;6;3;8;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;2227-7390;;MATHEMATICS-BASEL;Mathematics;FEB;2021;9;4;;;;;;;345;10.3390/math9040345;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/math9040345;;;30;Mathematics;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Mathematics;QP9MH;;gold;;;2023-12-25;WOS:000624152500001;View Full Record in Web of Science

A quantitative analysis shows the influence of longitudinal stresses in the outer parts of the steel strip on the metal pressure in the deformation zone. An equation is proposed for calculating the coefficient of the influence of unevenness and distribution of longitudinal stresses along the strip width at the exit from the mill on the pressure of the metal on the rolls. A computer-aided design (CAD) system was used to model and calculate the deformation and strength indicators of rolling thin strips, taking into account the influence of the characteristics of the rigid ends on the deformation zone. The graphs of the distribution of normal and tangential stresses along the length of the deformation zone are calculated depending on the longitudinal stresses. I. M. Pavlov's theory about the significant influence of the external hard parts of the strip on the pressure of the metal on the rolls is empirically demonstrated. Based on the results of the experiments, an equation is proposed that takes into account the effect of the uneven longitudinal stresses in the outer parts and the stiffness of the strip on the pressure. The equation for determining the average metal pressure on the rolls is refined, taking into account the influence of the outer parts of the strip on the deformation zone during thin-sheet rolling.;"[Shatalov, R.

The enzyme derivative Mut I with mutations W64A/W67A in the negative subsites of the catalytic cleft resulted in a 5.5-fold increase of the K-m value. Mut I produced oligosaccharides of various lengths in addition to xyloglucan building blocks. The W320A/W321A substitutions in the positive subsites of the mutated enzyme Mut II catalytic cleft increased the K-m value 54-fold and resulted in an endo-dissociative mode of action. The ability of Mut II to reduce the viscosity of xyloglucan at 50 degrees C was much better than that of other MtXgh74 variants. Besides, Mut II efficiently reduced viscosity of a natural substrate, the pulp of xyloglucan-containing tamarind seed flour. The K-m, V-max, and k(cat) values and viscosity reduction ability of the enzyme derivative Mut III (W320A/W321A/G446Y) returned to levels close to that of MtXgh74. The pattern of xyloglucan hydrolysis by Mut III was typical for endo-processive xyloglucanases. The thermostability of Mut I and Mut II at 60 degrees C decreased significantly compared to the wild type, whereas the thermostability of Mut III at 60 degrees C restored almost to the MtXgh74-wt value. All mutants lost the ability to cleave the backbone of xyloglucan building blocks which was a characteristic of MtXgh74. Instead they acquired a low branch removing activity.

This technique allows the synthesis of NWs array with its certain surface density and diameter (from dozen to hundreds of nm). NWs length also may be varied (order of pm) by controlling deposition time. Here we grow vertical Ag-NWs which are leaning towards their nearest neighbors, forming self-assembled bundles whose parameters depend on the NW aspect ratio (length to diameter). We show that in such bundles there are hot spots in the nm-gaps between NWs tips. Computer simulations have demonstrated a strong enhancement of the electric field within these hot spots; thus, the Raman signal is markedly amplified for analyte molecules placed directly inside the gaps. We have experimentally proved the potential of this SERS-technique on the example of 4-Mercaptophenylboronic acid (4-MPBA). For 4-MPBA the maximal enhancement of Raman signal was found at NWs length of similar to 1.6 mu m and diameter of similar to 100 nm. The effect is higher (up to twice) if wet substrate is used just immediately after the TM polymer removal so that the tips are brought to lean after analyte exposure. We suggest this new type of nanostructured SERS-substrates as a base of effective sensing of extremely low concentration of analytes.";"[Kozhina, Elizaveta P.; Bedin, Sergey A.; Andreev, Stepan N.; Naumov, Andrey V.] Moscow State Pedag Univ, Lab Adv Mat Phys, Shpolskii Theoret Phys Chair, Moscow 119435, Russia; [Bedin, Sergey A.; Grigoriev, Yuriy V.] RAS, Ctr Crystallog & Photon, Thin Film Growth Labs & Inorgan Nanostruct, Moscow 119333, Russia; [Nechaeva, Natalia L.; Podoynitsyn, Sergey N.] RAS, NM Emanuel Inst Biochem Phys, Lab Chem Phys Bioanalyt Proc, Moscow 119334, Russia; [Tarakanov, Vladimir P.] RAS, Joint Inst High Temp, Powerful Electromagnet Lab, Moscow 125412, Russia; [Andreev, Stepan N.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Maths Dept, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Naumov, Andrey V.] RAS, Inst Spect, Lab Spect Elect Spectra Mol, Moscow Troitsk 108840, Russia";"Moscow State University of Education; Russian Academy of Sciences; FSRC Crystallography & Photonics RAS; Russian Academy of Sciences; Emanuel Institute of Biochemical Physics; Russian Academy of Sciences; Joint Institute for High Temperatures of the Russian Academy of Sciences; Moscow Polytechnic University; Russian Academy of Sciences; Institute of Spectroscopy";"Kozhina, EP; Naumov, AV (автор для корреспонденции), Moscow State Pedag Univ, Lab Adv Mat Phys, Shpolskii Theoret Phys Chair, Moscow 119435, Russia.;Naumov, AV (автор для корреспонденции), RAS, Inst Spect, Lab Spect Elect Spectra Mol, Moscow Troitsk 108840, Russia.";"Liza.kozhina.99@mail.ru; bserg5@gmail.com; nechaeva.n.l@yandex.ru; spod2@mail.ru; karat8tarak@gmail.com; andreev_stepan@mail.ru; ckpicras@mail.ru; a_v_naumov@mail.ru";"Andreev, Stepan/G-9046-2016; Bedin, Sergey/B-4475-2014; Kozhina, Elizaveta/AAF-2598-2021; Naumov, Andrei/E-8905-2010; Andreev, Stepan/AAO-7893-2021; Tarakanov, Vladimir/AAE-3859-2021";"Andreev, Stepan/0000-0003-3588-2894; Bedin, Sergey/0000-0002-7342-124X; Naumov, Andrei/0000-0001-7938-9802; Tarakanov, Vladimir/0000-0003-1033-8964";"Ministry of Education of Russia [AAAA-A20-120061890084-9]; Ministry of Science and High Education of Russia [AAAA-A20-120061890084-9]; Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR) [18-29-12099, 20-03-00923]";"Ministry of Education of Russia; Ministry of Science and High Education of Russia; Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR)(Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR))";This research was funded by the Ministry of Education of Russia and Ministry of Science and High Education of Russia (project State number AAAA-A20-120061890084-9 Physics of nanostructured materials: fundamental research and applications in materials science, nanotechnology and photonics and by the Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR), project number 18-29-12099.

Herein, we report the first example of water treatment under simultaneous hydrodynamic cavitation and plasma discharge with the intense generation of radicals, UV light, shock waves and charged particles. This highly reactive environment is well suited to the bulk treatment of polluted water (i.e. E. coli disinfection and organic pollutant degradation). We have developed a new prototype and have efficiently applied this hybrid technology to water disinfection and the complete degradation of methanol in water with the aim of demonstrating its scalability. We have analyzed the mechanisms of water disinfection under the abovementioned conditions and verified them by measuring cavitation noise spectra and plasma emission spectra.

It is only natural that they greatly influence the educational industry, changing the approaches, methods and forms of education. Currently e-learning and distance technologies are being actively introduced into both academic and corporate education, as complementary to traditional forms. The efforts of teachers are aimed at finding effective models of blended learning. All this determines the relevance of the present study. The abstracted article is aimed at developing frameworks of a distance learning model based on the use of modern learning management systems. To obtain thorough and reliable results the authors make use of two research approaches: acmeological and competence-based. They review the features, the scope and use of the existing LMS platforms and work out tools for the development of e-learning system. In addition, they assess the compliance of e-learning tools with the preferences of X, Y and Z generation users. The outcome of the research is the development of a universal competency that can be applied to the study of modern methods and approaches with reference to both academic teaching and learning, and to corporate training. It is quite apparent that pros and cons of the learning management system and its possibilities should be carefully studied and thoughtfully used. The effective e-learning requires constant monitoring of equipment, proper work of host servers and considering user-friendliness of the platforms. This is related to the fact that public educational organizations, including schools, colleges and universities, especially in low developed countries, prefer traditional teaching methods and are slowly moving to innovative models. The research findings can be viewed as a step forward in creating user-friendly and flexible e-learning platforms, suitable for separate users, institutions and businesses. They can be applied for further assessment of existing learning models, especially for the younger generation, and for research and development of new strategies and methods of using learning management systems and platforms.;"[Shurygin, Viktor] Kazan Fed Univ, Elabuga Inst Branch, Yelabuga, Russia; [Saenko, Natalya] Moscow Polytech Univ, Moscow, Russia; [Zekiy, Angelina] Sechenov First Moscow State Med Univ, Moscow, Russia; [Klochko, Elena] Kuban State Agr Univ, Dept Management, Krasnodar, Russia; [Kulapov, Mikhail] Plekhanov Russian Univ Econ, Moscow, Russia";"Kazan Federal University; Moscow Polytechnic University; Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University; Kuban State Agrarian University; Plekhanov Russian University of Economics";Shurygin, V (автор для корреспонденции), Kazan Fed Univ, Elabuga Inst Branch, Yelabuga, Russia.;viktor_shurygin@mail.ru;"Shurygin, Viktor/L-9596-2013; Saenko, Natalya Ryafikovna/AAQ-5703-2020; Klochko, Elena/AAD-7132-2019";"Shurygin, Viktor/0000-0003-1418-2899;";;;;;89;6;7;1;15;KASSEL UNIV PRESS GMBH;KASSEL;DIAGONALE 10, D-34127 KASSEL, GERMANY;1863-0383;;;INT J EMERG TECHNOL;Int.

Unprecedented challenges caused by the COVID-19 crisis in the tourism sector, on the one hand, questioned the possibility of fulfilling the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the goals of sustainable tourism. On the other hand, they emphasized the need for balance between three pillars of sustainability, both as an urgency tool to cope with the pandemic crisis and as a solid basis for long-term development in the post-pandemic period. The study presented in the paper discusses sustainability issues in rural tourism as one of the most promising sectors for the development of domestic tourism on the example of the Russian tourism industry. The overall goal of the study initiated in the pre-pandemic period is to find ways to support sustainable rural tourism in Russian regions and to develop indicators for monitoring the effectiveness of local strategic development programs, taking into account national and regional specifics. This paper discusses intermediate results obtained with the adjustment for pandemic challenges. The authors combined a number of methods and techniques, namely desk research, statistical analysis, and analysis of empirical data obtained by means of in-depth interviews, as well as a survey using a formal questionnaire. The results confirm that Russian enterprises and local communities considered the three pillars of sustainability as important to develop tourism in rural destinations both in the pre-pandemic period and in times of challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. At the same time, the findings show weaknesses in the federal and local policy, including the lack of systemic measures to improve the sustainable management of Russian tourism destinations. From the authors' point of view, it makes sense to adapt the European tourism indicator system for sustainable destinations (ETIS) for local peculiarities. ETIS is a useful tool to boost the sustainable development of rural destinations by encouraging stakeholder engagement and monitoring processes. In the case of Russia, one needs to add indicators for monitoring the effectiveness of the implementation of strategic development programs in the field of tourism.;"[Polukhina, Anna] Volga State Univ Technol, Dept Serv & Tourism, Yoshkar Ola 424000, Russia; [Sheresheva, Marina] Lomonosov Moscow State Univ, Dept Econ, Moscow 119991, Russia; [Sheresheva, Marina; Efremova, Marina] Natl Res Lobachevsky State Univ Nizhny Novgorod, Dept Serv & Tourism, Nizhnii Novgorod 603950, Russia; [Suranova, Oxana] Baikal State Univ, Dept Econ & Entrepreneurship, Irkutsk 664003, Russia; [Agalakova, Oksana] Vyatka State Univ, Dept Tourism & Personnel Management, Kirov 610000, Russia; [Antonov-Ovseenko, Anton] Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Publishing & Bibliol, Moscow 115280, Russia";"Volga State University of Technology; Lomonosov Moscow State University; Lobachevsky State University of Nizhni Novgorod; Baikal State University; Vyatka State University; Moscow Polytechnic University";"Sheresheva, M (автор для корреспонденции), Lomonosov Moscow State Univ, Dept Econ, Moscow 119991, Russia.;Sheresheva, M (автор для корреспонденции), Natl Res Lobachevsky State Univ Nizhny Novgorod, Dept Serv & Tourism, Nizhnii Novgorod 603950, Russia.";"PoluhinaAN@volgatech.net; m.sheresheva@gmail.com; emvnki@mail.ru; suranovaisu@mail.ru; oksaga7121@mail.ru; anton.antonov.ovseenko@gmail.com";"Антонов-Овсеенко, Антон Антонович/AAV-1154-2020; Polukhina, Anna Nicolaevna/Q-1154-2016; SURANOVA, OKSANA/HLG-1631-2023; Sheresheva, Marina/AAH-4719-2021";"SURANOVA, OKSANA/0000-0001-5902-6465; Sheresheva, Marina/0000-0002-8153-7111";National Research Lobachevsky State University of Nizhny Novgorod, the research project Sustainable development of small and medium-sized businesses in the face of big challenges [H-443-99_2020-2021];National Research Lobachevsky State University of Nizhny Novgorod, the research project Sustainable development of small and medium-sized businesses in the face of big challenges;This research was funded by the National Research Lobachevsky State University of Nizhny Novgorod, the research project Sustainable development of small and medium-sized businesses in the face of big challenges, grant number H-443-99_2020-2021.;;96;35;35;7;47;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;1911-8066;1911-8074;;J RISK FINANC MANAG;J.

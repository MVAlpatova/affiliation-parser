Here, a novel approach, in the case of HECs, is used to prepare powder and bulk (Ti,Zr,Hf,Nb,Ta)C: the calcium-hydride reduction (CHR) of oxides, followed by pressureless sintering (PS) and spark plasma sintering (SPS). The material obtained is characterized via TEM, SEM, and XRD. It has been shown that the CHR provides the formation of the nano-sized powder with a multiphase structure consisting of binary carbides. Subsequent PS and SPS lead to the formation of a single-phase structure; however, porosity differs significantly. As a bulk state, (Ti,Zr,Hf,Nb,Ta)C exhibits typical high hardness (20.4 GPa) and good fracture toughness (4.2 MPa∙m1/2). The results have shown that calcium-hydride reduction process, with proper development, can provide a new cost-effective technology for the synthesis of nano and submicron powders of high-entropy carbides. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Calcium-hydride synthesis; High-entropy carbide; Metallothermic reduction; Phase composition; Spark plasma sintering","Carbides; Cost effectiveness; Ductile fracture; Entropy; Fabrication; Fracture toughness; Hydrides; Temperature; Titanium oxides; Zirconium compounds; Calcium hydride; Calcium hydride reductions; Calcium-hydride synthesis; Carbide ceramics; High-entropy carbide; Lows-temperatures; Metallothermic reduction; Pressureless-sintering; Property; Spark-plasma-sintering; Spark plasma sintering","","","","","Russian Science Foundation, RSF, (18–79-10215); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2022YFB3705400); Project 211, (BP0820014)","This study was conducted with the financial support of the Russian Science Foundation (Grant No. 18–79-10215 ), the National Key Research and Development Program of China ( 2022YFB3705400 ) and the Programme of Introducing Talents of Discipline to Universities of China ( BP0820014 ).

It has been established experimentally that when temperature-time parameters are violated, defects in the form of weld discontinuities are localized at the weld-base metal boundary, the formation of which is caused by the incompatibility of the weld metal deformation and the adjacent base material. It is shown that the mechanism of destruction of a welded joint is determined by the presence of defects reducing the effective cross-section of the welded joint. © Allerton Press, Inc. 2023.","aluminum alloy 1565ch; defect; discontinuity; feed per revolution; friction stir welding; mode parameters; strength; structure","Aluminum alloys; Defects; Friction; Research laboratories; Welds; Aluminum alloy 1565ch; Butt joints; Deformation effects; Discontinuity; Feed per revolution; Friction-stir-welding; Frictional heating; Metal plates; Mode parameter; Strength; Friction stir welding","","","","","","","Drits A.M., Ovchinnikov V.V., Rastopchin R.N., Technological properties of sheets made of weldable aluminum alloy 1565ch for production of tank vessels, Tekhnol.

According to the performed study, the main cause of downtimes in the technological production cycle and decreased geometric quality indicators of rolled products is related to deteriorated mechanical properties of the deforming tool. Significant temperature variations (more than 250°C) along the length of the piercing and pressing tool, made of 4Kh5MFS steel, during the hot pressure treatment were revealed. The main reasons leading to deterioration of the tool quality were established, including the loss of its strength and hardness, as well as an increase in the ductility of a piercing mandrel and a punch of up to 30 and 19%, respectively.

The effect of these elements on the structure and mechanical properties of the new sheet Al2Cu1.5Mn alloy designed for Al20Cu2Mn3 dispersoids has been studied by calculations and experimental methods. The obtained data on the phase composition, microstructure, and physical and mechanical properties of the new alloy for different processing routes (including hot rolling, cold rolling, and annealing) have been compared with those for the ternary Mg- and Zn-free alloy. It has been shown that the formation of nanosized Al20Cu2Mn3 dispersoids (~7 vol.%) provides for the preservation of the non-recrystallized grain structure after annealing at up to 400 °C (3 h), while Mg and Zn have a positive effect on the strength due to the formation of alloyed aluminum solid solution. As a result, cold-rolled sheets of the Al2Cu1.5Mn1Mg1Zn model alloy showed a substantially higher strength performance after annealing at 400 °C in comparison with the ternary reference alloy. In particular, the UTS is ~360 vs. ~300 MPa, and the YS is 280 vs. 230 MPa. For the example of the Al2Cu1.5Mn1Mg1Zn model alloy, it has been shown that the system is promising for designing new heat-resistant alloys as a sustainable alternative to the 2xxx alloys. The new alloy has an advantage over the commercial alloys (particularly, 2219, 2024, 2014), not only in manufacturability but also in thermal stability. The sheet production cycle for the model alloy is much shorter because the stages of homogenization, solution treatment, and water quenching are excluded. © 2023 by the authors.","Al<sub>20</sub>Cu<sub>2</sub>Mn<sub>3</sub> dispersoids; Al–Cu–Mn–Mg–Zn system; annealing; mechanical properties; phase composition; structure evolution; thermal stability","","","","","","Moscow Polytechnic University; Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation, Minobrnauka, (075-15-2021-696); Russian Science Foundation, RSF, (20-19-00249-P)","Funding text 1: The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the Russian Science Foundation (Project No. 20-19-00249-P) (Conceptualization, SEM, hardness and electrical conductivity tests, tensile tests, discussion) and financial support by the Moscow Polytechnic University within the framework of the grant named after Pyotr Kapitsa (TEM, Thermo-Calc calculations).; Funding text 2: The results were obtained by using the equipment of the Center for Collective Use ‘Materials Science and Metallurgy’ with the financial support of the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation (#075-15-2021-696).

It is shown that the number of (Formula presented.) particles escaping boron target and arriving at track detectors is less than 5% of the total amount of (Formula presented.) particles, because the majority of these particles remain inside the target owing to ionization losses. The derived values of the yield of (Formula presented.) particles’ which arrive at detectors are in good agreement with the experimental data.

The research is aimed at improving the parameters of the mechanical activation effect produced on technogenic georesources, as well as at expanding the application scope of disintegrators in the field of using the partial backfill of the mined-out space when developing stratified deposits. In this regard, the research purpose was to substantiate the parameters of extracting metals from enrichment tailings using their mechanochemical activation to ensure cyclic waste management. The research involved the application of three-dimensional interpolation methods used for processing the data and the graphical representation. As a result, the following was found to be characteristic of the waste of the Sadonsky mine management. The degree of extracting zinc from pre-activated tailings increases logarithmically when the H2SO4 concentration and the NaCl proportion decrease 3.5 times. The degree of extracting lead from the activated tailings increases according to the Fourier law when decreasing the NaCl mass concentration, and an optimal range of the H2SO4 (0.38–0.51%) proportion decreases six times. One of the key results of the research is the justification of expanding the scope of applying disintegrators in the case of a directed activation influence exerted on the components of the stowing strips. The obtained results expand the understanding of the mechanism of the influence of the mechanochemical activation of dry tailings on the reactivity unevenness when extracting several metals from them. © 2023 by the authors.","chemical activation; circular waste management; environmental management; failure (mechanical); heavy metals and pollution; hydrometallurgical process; leaching Pb; resource use efficiency; sustainable production","Data handling; Environmental impact; Environmental management; Environmental technology; Extraction; Failure (mechanical); Heavy metals; Leaching; Mining; Sodium chloride; Sustainable development; Waste management; Circular waste management; Failure (mechanical); Heavy metal and pollution; Hydrometallurgical process; Leaching pb; Mechano-chemical activation; Resource use; Resource use efficiency; Sustainable production; Use efficiency; Chemical activation","","","","","","","Chen X., Zhao B., Shuai C., Qu S., Xu M., Global spread of water scarcity risk through trade, Resour.

A fire is extinguished better when the right type of fire retardant is used. A thumb rule on firefighting also says, “never fight a fire if you do not know what is burning”. In this paper, we have proposed an Intelligent Decision Support System (ID2S4FH) to generate a real-time ‘fire-map’ of such SDCs during a fire hazard. We have interfaced six tin-oxide-based gas sensor elements, a temperature and humidity sensor, and a particulate matter (PM) sensor with microcontrollers to capture the real-time signature patterns of the ambient air. We burned sixteen different types of materials belonging to six classes of fire and created a dataset consisting of 2400 samples. The sensor array responses were then pre-processed and analysed using various classifiers trained in different analysis space domains. Among the classifiers, four classifiers achieved ‘all correct’ identification of the fire classes of 80 unknown test samples, and the lowest mean squared error (MSE) achieved was 2.81 × 10−3. During a fire hazard, our proposed ID2S4FH can generate real-time fire maps of SDCs and help firefighters to extinguish the fire using the appropriate fire retardant. © 2023 by the authors.","Arduino UNO; fire detection; fire extinguisher; Intelligent Gas Sensor System (IGSS); particulate matter; PM 10; PM 2.5","","","","","","","","Deem F.S., Firefighter Fatality Investigation, (2016); Hurley M.J., Gottuk D.T., Hall J.R., Harada K., Kuligowski E.D., Puchovsky M., Torero L., Watts J., Wieczorek C., SFPE Handbook of Fire Protection Engineering, pp. 724-744, (2016); Fire and Smoke: Understanding the Hazards, (1986); Aronstein J., Carrier D.W., Molded Case Circuit Breakers—Some Holes in the Electrical Safety Net, IEEE Access, 6, pp. 10062-10068, (2018); Evarts B., Campbell R., Firefighter Injuries in the United States in 2019; Gliszczynska-Swiglo A., Chmielewski J., Electronic nose as a tool for monitoring the authenticity of food: A review, Food Anal.

An AlSi10Mg-alloy-based powder composition with the addition of 0.5 wt % CNFs is prepared by mechanical activation. The optimum SLM parameters have been determined to achieve a synthesized AMC density of at least 99%. The preservation of CNFs in the structure of AMC and the formation of Al4C3 inclusions, which have a higher strength and hardness compared to the initial AlSi10Mg aluminum alloy, lead to hardening of the synthesized material, the microhardness of which is 149 ± 8 HV, which is 20% higher than the hardness of the AlSi10Mg alloy. © Pleiades Publishing, Ltd. 2023.","additive manufacturing; aluminum matrix composite material; carbon nanofibers; selective laser melting","Additives; Aluminum alloys; Aluminum compounds; Hardness; Melting; Selective laser melting; Silicon; Silicon alloys; Aluminium matrix composites; Aluminum matrix composite material; Carbon nanofibres; Composites material; High hardness; High-strength; Mechanical activation; Powder composition; Selective laser melting; Synthesised; Carbon nanofibers","","","","","Russian Science Foundation, RSF, (19-79-30025)","This work was supported by the Russian Science Foundation, project no. 19-79-30025 (Development of scientific and technological fundamentals for designing aluminum matrix composites and their additive manufacturing by laser methods for industrial applications).

The experimental results have been compared with data for the AA2219 commercial alloy pertaining to the same alloying system. Hot deformation of an experimental alloy causes the precipitation of ~100 nm sized dispersoids and refinement of the eutectic phase particles. The yield strength and relative elongation of the hot-deformed experimental alloy are 255 MPa and 8.6%, respectively. Subsequent cold deformation reduces the relative elongation by 3.5% and increases the yield strength by 50 MPa, while the ultimate tensile strength does not change. After long-term 350 °C exposure, the mechanical properties of the experimental alloy remain the same as those of the as-deformed one, whereas the yield strength of the 2219 alloy decreases by 2 times and the ultimate tensile strength by 1.4 times. Comparison of these experimental results with data for the 2219 alloy and other Al-Cu-Mn system alloys cited in this work and reported elsewhere suggests that a good thermal stability of Al-2Cu-2Mn-0.4Si-0.2Zr alloy rolled stock can be achieved through treatment using the regimes designed herein. © 2023 by the authors.","Al-Cu-Mn system; aluminum alloy; deformation; mechanical properties; microstructure; thermostability","","","","","","Moscow Polytechnic University","This work was financially supported by the Moscow Polytechnic University within the framework of the grant named after Pyotr Kapitsa.","Kammer C., Aluminum and Aluminum Alloys, Springer Handbook of Materials Data, pp. 161-197, (2018); Davis J.R., Aluminum and Aluminum Alloys, ASM Specialty Handbook, (1993); Ber L.B., Kolobnev N.I., Tsukrov S.L., Heat Treatment of Aluminum Alloys, (2020); Fine M.E., Precipitation Hardening of Aluminum Alloys, Metall.

However, achieving a balance between strength and functional properties remains a significant challenge in Mg alloys community. Typically, strength depends on the pinning effect of defects, such as solute atoms and second phases, which hinder dislocation motion. On the other hand, optimal functional properties usually necessitate relative perfect crystal structures, as the presence of solute atoms and second phases can have adverse effects on damping capacity and thermal conductivity. Balancing these conflicting requirements is difficult. The trade-off between strength and functional properties of the Mg alloys should be broken to meet the urgent need in aerospace, automotive, 3C (computers, communications, and consumer electronics) and energy industries for high performance structural-functional integrated Mg-based materials. This review summarizes recent progress in understanding the mechanisms and influencing factors for the functional properties of Mg alloys. The mechanisms underlying the trade-off between strength and functional properties of Mg alloys is discussed. The latest developed structural-functional integrated Mg alloys and their composites are summarized, including high strength Mg-based materials with high damping capacity / high thermal conductivity / strong electromagnetic shielding capability / excellent flame-resistance / high dissolution rate. The future works of developing structure-function integrated Mg-based materials are proposed. © 2023","Composites; Damping capacity; Dissolvability; Electromagnetic interference shielding; Ignition resistance; Strength; Structure-function integrated Mg alloys; Thermal conductivity","Damping; Economic and social effects; Electromagnetic pulse; Electromagnetic wave interference; Flame resistance; Magnesium alloys; Signal interference; Structural properties; Thermal conductivity; Damping capacity; Dissolvability; Electromagnetic interference shielding; Functional properties; Ignition resistances; Mg alloy; Strength; Strength property; Structure functions; Structure-function integrated mg alloy; Electromagnetic shielding","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51771062, 51971076, U21A2047); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2022YFE0109600)","This work is partially supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China ( No. U21A2047, No. 51971076, and No. 51771062 ) and National Key Research and Development Program of China ( No. 2022YFE0109600) .","Avedesian M.M., Baker H., ASM Specialty Handbook: Magnesium and Magnesium Alloys, (1999); Ma Y., Liu C., Jiang S., Gao Y., Wan Y., Chen Z., Mater.

The kinetic dependences of kerosene mass loss in a diffusion cell differ from the conventional dependences that confine the application of commonly accepted parameters in estimating the diffusion permeability of polymers and the natural loss prediction model. An approach to estimating the rate of natural kerosene loss under storage is proposed. The correlation between the natural loss rate at different kerosene storage temperatures and the kerosene vapor pressure at room temperature is established to simplify the method of estimating the diffusion permeability of thermoplastic polyurethane by kerosene. © 2023, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","diffusion permeability; kerosene; thermoplastic polyurethane; vapor pressure","Diffusion; Hydrostatic pressure; Kerosene; Reinforced plastics; Diffusion cells; Diffusion permeability; Loss prediction; Loss rates; Mass loss; Prediction modelling; Saturated vapor pressure; Storage temperatures; Thermoplastic polyurethanes; Vapour pressures; Polyurethanes","","","","","","","Karadeniz K., Zalikoglu Y., Sen M.Y., A novel polyurethane from epoxidized soybean oil synthesized by ring opening with bifunctional compounds, Polym.

Vernadsky State Geological Museum of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russian Federation","One of the issues of non-ferrous metallurgy is the high losses of metals during concentration as part of complex processing of the ores. The mineral resource base of non-ferrous metals in Russia is affected by the shortcomings of certain concentration processes that have a negative impact on the efficiency of commodity production. Human-generated wastes of non-ferrous metallurgy industries often form reserves that are comparable to the natural deposits of primary ores. In addition to the economic losses from incomplete metal recovery, dumping of mining waste creates environmental problems. Current Russian technologies fail to ensure waste-free concentration processes. Upgrading of the concentration processes is done through introduction of hydro-metallurgical treatment operations, which results in changes of the mineral properties that leads to better ore liberation and enhanced metal recovery. It is also possible to increase the metal recovery by boosting the activity of minerals through their treatment with surfactants. The efficiency of mechanochemical activation of the leaching processes has been discussed in the leading Russian and foreign scientific journals and magazines, and is being further developed in research activities on the subject. The technology performance is improved when traditional technologies are combined with new wastefree hydrometallurgical processes through introduction of disintegrator-type activators into the process flow. © 2023, Scientific and Industrial company 'Gemos Ltd.'.

It is shown that these dyes produce stable floating layers with a certain number of three-dimensional aggregates at the air/water interface. The floating layers retain their structure when transferred to a glass substrate by the Langmuir-Schaefer method, demonstrating the H-aggregation of the dyes. In contrast to the initial monohydroxyphthalocyanine 1, thin films of its derivatives, cyclotriphosphazene-substituted monomer 2 and dimer 3, show a slight increase in absorption when the number of deposited layers exceeds 100. It is shown that thin films of the studied dyes 1–3 can be used in the technology of optical limitation of laser radiation, demonstrating a good cutting efficiency of dangerous nanosecond pulses. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Floating layers; Langmuir-Schaefer films; Nanosecond nonlinear absorbance; Phthalocyanine derivatives; Supramolecular organization; UV/Vis/NIR spectral studies","Dimers; Glass substrates; Monomers; Spectroscopic analysis; Supramolecular chemistry; Thin films; Absorbances; Cyclotriphosphazenes; Floating layer; Langmuir-schaefer films; Nanosecond nonlinear absorbance; Phthalocyanine derivatives; Spectral studies; Supramolecular organizations; UV-vis-NIR; UV/vis/NIR spectral study; Absorbance","","","","","Moscow Polytechnic University; Russian Foundation for Basic Research, РФФИ, (20–47–370002); Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation, Minobrnauka, (075-15-2021-596, FZZM-2023-0009); Russian Science Foundation, RSF, (21-73-20016); Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation; I.M.

Since the energy intensity of the industry remains quite high, the task of rationalizing the consumption of electricity is relevant. One of the ways to improve control accuracy when planning energy costs is to forecast electrical loads. Despite the large number of scientific papers on the topic of electricity consumption forecasting, this problem remains relevant due to the changing requirements of the wholesale electricity and power market to the accuracy of forecasts. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to support management decisions in the process of planning the volume of electricity consumption. To realize this, it is necessary to create a predictive model and determine the prospective power consumption of the power system. For this purpose, the collection and analysis of initial data, their preprocessing, selection of features, creation of models, and their optimization were carried out. The created models are based on historical data on planned power consumption, power system performance (frequency), as well as meteorological data. The research methods were: ensemble methods of machine learning (random forest, gradient boosting algorithms, such as XGBoost and CatBoost) and a long short-term memory recurrent neural network model (LSTM). The models obtained as a result of the conducted studies allow creating short-term forecasts of power consumption with a fairly high precision (for a period from one day to a week). The use of models based on gradient boosting algorithms and neural network models made it possible to obtain a forecast with an error of less than 1 %, which makes it possible to recommend the models described in the paper for use in forecasting the planned electricity power consumption of united power systems. © 2023, Saint-Petersburg Mining University.

Corrosive environment: gas condensate under a pressure of 6.5–7.5 MPa, temperature of 60°C and density of 826 kg/m3 contained water with a total mineralization of 12.75 g/m3, hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide 3.5 and 4.76% (vol.), respectively. A fragment is cut out of the pipe at the inner surface that has through corrosion failure in the form of a triangle, at the base of which, apparently there is a manufacturing macro defect that propagates in the direction of gas condensate movement. Corrosion damage located along the perimeter of the triangle has two characteristic areas: uniform, close to a through hole, and intense corrosion. The width of each of the regions reaches 30 mm in the areas located at the apex of a triangle. The transition from uniform to intense corrosion is accompanied by formation of black protrusions 4–6 mm high and up to 3 mm in diameter, which collapse during transition into the area of general uniform corrosion observed over the rest of the pipe inner surface. The authors attribute features of the nature of corrosion damage observed to interaction of corrosion-active non-metallic inclusions (CANI) with gas condensate and an accelerating effect of hydrogen penetrating into steel on the corrosion process along with appearance and an increase in the level of triaxial tensile stresses in the vicinity of corrosion-active non-metallic inclusions. © 2023, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","corrosion nature and rate; gas condensate; pipe steel; steel hydrogenation","Carbon dioxide; Gases; Hydrogen sulfide; Pipeline corrosion; Pipelines; Steel corrosion; Steel pipe; Corrosion damage; Corrosion failures; Corrosion nature and rate; Corrosive environment; Cut-out; Inner surfaces; Mineralisation; Non-metallic inclusions; Steel hydrogenation; Uzbekistan; Gas condensates","","","","","","","Rodionova I.G., Zaitsev A.Y., Baklanova O.N., Golovanov A.V., Endel N.I., Shapovalov E.T., Semerin G.V., Contemporary Approaches to Improving Corrosion Resistance and Operating Reliability of Steels for Oil industry Pipelines, (2012); Rodionova I.G., Baklanova I.N., Zaitsev A.I., Role of non-metallic inclusions in acceleration of local corrosion processes of oil industry pipelines made of carbon low-alloy steels, Metally, No., 5, pp. 13-18, (2004); Zaitsev A.I., Rodionova I.G., Semernin G.V., Et al., New types of unfavourable non-metallic inclusions based upon MgO–Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and metallurgical factors governing their content within metal.

RESULTS: It has been investigated how magnesium oxide and cerium oxide interact to affect the crystal structure, morphology and microstructure of the materials produced. It was assumed that CeO2 forms on the surface of MgO while the material's developed surface is preserved. The values of the specific surface area and average pore diameter of the studied samples depend on the composition and vary in the ranges of 16–41 m2 g−1 and 11.919 nm, respectively. CONCLUSION: It has been established that the sizes of CeO2 crystallites in the composition of nanocomposites change insignificantly and range from 6.5 to 7.4 nm. The photocatalytic activity of the studied samples is at least two times higher compared to analogs. The samples MgO–CeO2 (30 mol%) and MgO–CeO2 (50 mol%) showed the maximum photodegradation efficiency of acid telon blue and direct bright blue dyes at levels of 98.5% and 92.5%, respectively. © 2023 The Authors.

To configure and digitally commission automated drives, two-mass electromechanical system models are used. A promising area in which to implement such models is the development of digital shadows, namely drive position observers. Connecting virtual models for online data exchange predetermines the tightening of requirements for their parameter calculation accuracy. Therefore, developing accessible techniques for calculating electromechanical system coordinates is an urgent problem. These parameters are most accurately defined by experiments. The contribution of this paper is the proposition of a method for defining the two-mass system model parameters using the oscillograms obtained in the operating and emergency modes. The method is developed for the horizontal stand drives of a plate mill 5000 and is supported by numerical examples. The technique is universal and comprises calculating the rotating mass inertia torques, elastic stiffness and oscillation damping coefficients, and the time constants of the motor air gap torque control loop. The obtained results have been applied to the development of the elastic torque observer of the rolling stand’s electromechanical system. A satisfactory coordinate recovery accuracy has been approved for both open and closed angular gaps in mechanical joints. Recommendations are given for the use of the method in developing process parameter control algorithms based on automated drive position observers. This contributes to the development of the theory and practice of building digital control systems and the implementation of the Industry 4.0 concept in industrial companies. © 2023 by the authors.","adequacy; definition; digital twin; electromechanical system; method; parameters; position observer; rolling mill; two-mass model","","","","","","Moscow Polytechnic University","This work was financially supported by the Moscow Polytechnic University within the framework of the grant named after Pyotr Kapitsa.","Falekas G., Karlis A., Digital Twin in Electrical Machine Control and Predictive Maintenance: State-of-the-Art and Future Prospects, Energies, 14, (2021); (2022); Becue A., Maia E., Feeken L., Borchers P., Praca I., A New Concept of Digital Twin Supporting Optimization and Resilience of Factories of the Future, Appl.

The results of experiments on uniaxial tension for cylindrical samples of a granulated nickel alloy at high temperatures and various strain rates are presented.

The key characteristics that may be important for the manufacturing of piezoelectric deformable mirrors are the following: piezoelectric constants (d31, d33, d15), capacitance, elastic compliance values s for different crystal directions, and the dielectric loss tangent (tgδ). Based on PZT ceramics, the PKP-12 material was developed with high values of the dielectric constant, piezoelectric modulus, and electromechanical coupling coefficients. The deformable mirror control elements are made from the resulting material—piezoceramic combs with five individual actuators in a row. In this case, the stroke of the actuator is in the range of 4.1–4.3 microns and the capacitance of the actuator is about 12 nF. © 2023 by the authors.","adaptive optics; deformable mirrors; multilayer actuator; PZT materials; relaxor ferroelectrics; wavefront control","Actuators; Capacitance; Dielectric losses; Electromechanical coupling; Mirrors; Piezoelectric ceramics; Piezoelectricity; Deformable mirrors; Electrophysical properties; Key characteristics; Modular designs; Multilayer actuators; Piezoceramic materials; Piezostack; PZT materials; Relaxor ferroelectric; Wave front control; Adaptive optics","","","","","","","Curie J., Curie P., Développement par compression de l’électricité polaire dans les cristaux hémièdres à faces inclines, Bull.

The paper examines independent work as a substantial factor in self-education and learning and cognitive activities in management students and covers the organization of students’ independent work in the study of foreign languages. The study demonstrates that independent work, which used to be carried out immediately during practical classes under the teacher's supervision, in consultations, or in the library can now be organized in a new educational environment. The authors analyze the forms, means, and types of independent work and propose ways to improve the process of foreign language learning by optimizing the work of management students as part of self-study using the Moodle learning management system. It is established that the independent work of management students in studying a foreign language using Moodle contributes to the development of important skills. These include obtaining necessary information and evaluating and applying the available information to effectively solve management problems and communicate in a foreign language. The efficiency of students’ independent work is found to increase when it is organized as a cohesive course created based on a methodologically organized educational information environment. The assimilation of educational material by means of Moodle in the organization of the educational process majorly increases the efficiency of learning, simplifies the perception of learning materials, increases motivation for foreign language learning, and positively affects its outcomes. © 2023 ACADEMY PUBLICATION.","grammatical competence; independent work; lexical competence; students","","","","","","","","Al-Mubireek S., E-learning in the English classroom: Comparing two e-learning platforms impacting preparatory year students’ language learning, Computer-assisted Language Learning-Electronic Journal, 20, 2, pp. 19-37, (2019); Alan Y., Amac Z., Critical reading self efficacy and information pollution on the Internet: Preservice teachers’ perceptions, Shanlax International Journal of Education, 9, 4, pp. 178-189, (2021); Belozubov A.

The welded joints between the sheets of 09G2S steel were obtained through automatic argon arc welding. The fatigue tests were carried out under repeated tensile loading. The “maximum cycle stress—number of cycles to failure” fatigue curves of the samples were plotted. The fracture surfaces of the samples were studied, and the fatigue failure mechanisms were analyzed. It was shown that, during testing, all samples demonstrated cyclic hardening behavior. The samples of the base metal as delivered had the highest endurance limit, and the smallest endurance limit was found in the samples of the base metal and weld metal after overheating, the endurance limits of which were similar. The fracture mechanism of all samples was quasi-brittle with the presence of very thin fatigue micro-grooves. The final rupture of all samples had a ductile dimple type. © 2023 by the authors.","cyclic hardening; fractography; high-cycle fatigue; low-carbon low-alloy steel; microstructure; overheating","","","","","","","","Round Wire Rod for Welding Filler Metals, (1980); Budynas R.G., Nisbett J.K., Shigley’s Mechanical Engineering Design, pp. 49-52, (2011); Kuptsov S.G., Pleshchev V.P., Magomedova R.S., Nikonenko E.A., Shimov V.V., Hybrid Hardening of Structural Steel, Grade 09G2S, Steel Transl, 51, pp. 342-344, (2021); Kryukov R.E., Gromov V.E., Ivanov Y.F., Kozyrev N.A., Rubannikova Y.A., Fine Structure and Fracture Surface of Low-Carbon Steel Welds, Russ.

The article discusses a possible mechanism of amplification and generation during the preparation of earthquakes, during and after them (aftershocks). As was established earlier, when ultrasound of sufficient intensity passes through an ionic dielectric crystal, electromagnetic radiation is generated in the crystal at the ultrasound frequency and half the frequency. The results were obtained on igneous rocks (basalts, gabbros, granites). Aim. Research and analysis of the mechanism of amplification and generation of electromagnetic radiation during the passage of acoustic waves through igneous rocks. Research methodology. When conducting research, methods of geophysics and engineering geology, mathematical modeling, string theory, crystallography and mineralogy were used. Research results. As a result of the research, it was determined that during pulsed acoustic excitation, the amplitude parameters of electromagnetic compatibility significantly depend on the conductivity of the rock. Conclusion. Firstly, that random connections of “capacitors”, taking into account their oscillations in the field of seismic waves, can lead to an increase in the total potential (average potential multipliers), and secondly, in the field of a shock wave, T must be replaced by the effective temperature, which can increase the effective charge and intensity of EMR by several orders of magnitude. Thus, during the formation of cracks and the propagation of powerful acoustic waves in rocks, almost all components included in these rocks must contribute to the generation of EMR. © 2023, Geophysical Institute of the Vladikavkaz Scientific Centre of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

An urgent problem in higher education is the search for effective forms of learning that have didactic potential in terms of developing systematic, critical, creative, and other types of thinking demanded by the digital society. The authors propose to actively involve students in designing quests in the format of a collection of puzzles to develop critical thinking as a universal skill that meets the challenges of transformation and globalization. The purpose of the study is to study the influence of the participation of future teachers in the activity of constructing a quest as a collection of puzzles on the level of formation of their critical thinking. Research methods. At the stage of obtaining theoretical generalizations, an analysis of scientific works on the problem of gamification of learning and the use of digital resources for the intellectual development of the individual was used. The questions of the author's test for diagnosing critical thinking were compiled taking into account Bloom's classification. The quest, as a series of tasks united by a single didactic plot, is implemented in the environment of the Kvestodel designer. 60 students of Vyatka State University (Russian Federation) were involved in the design of a collection of puzzles for educational purposes. Training program - Pedagogical education, bachelor's level. Statistical processing of data was performed using Pearson's χ2 (chi-square) criterion. Results. Collections of puzzles are designed and used in the study of the disciplines “Modern Information Technologies” and “Technologies of Social and Professional Interaction” according to the following plan: analysis of educational needs and capabilities of teachers; studying the digital resource and its functionality; working in an environment for designing an escape room; presentation and defense of the project; application of a complete series of tasks in practice. Statistically significant differences were revealed in the qualitative changes that occurred in the pedagogical system (χ2 = 6.533; p < 0.05). In conclusion, the conditions are formulated under which, involving students in the design of quests as a collection of puzzles, will contribute to the creation of additional resources for the development of critical thinking: highly creative activity, participation in discussions, selection of sources and search for information, analysis of opinions (decisions), individual and group work on thinking through a series of tasks. © 2023 LLC Ecological Help.

The parameters of such oscillations depend on the sliding velocity in the contact patch. As they negatively affect the processes occurring in the electric drive and the mechanical transmission, reducing their energy efficiency, such processes can cause failures in various elements. This paper aims to conduct a theoretical study into the peculiarities of oscillatory processes in the nonlinear system and an experimental study of the auto-oscillation modes of an individual traction drive. It presents the theoretical basis used to analyze the peculiarities of oscillation processes, including their onset and course, the results of simulation mathematical modeling and the experimental studies into the oscillation phenomena in the movement of the vehicle towards the supporting base. The practical value of this study lies in the possibility to use the results in the development of algorithms for the exclusion of auto-oscillation phenomena in the development of vehicle control systems, as well as to use the auto-oscillation processes onset and course analysis methodology to design the electric drive of the driving wheels. © 2023 by the authors.","auto-oscillations; Bendixson criterion; electric bus; friction; mathematical model; traction electric drive; wheel sliding","Control system synthesis; Curricula; Electric drives; Electric traction; Energy efficiency; Nonlinear systems; Traction control; Vehicle wheels; Auto-oscillations; Bendixson criteria; Electric bus; Moving vehicles; Oscillation phenomenon; Oscillatory process; Sliding velocities; Traction drive; Traction electric drives; Wheel sliding; Electric buses","","","","","Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation, Minobrnauka, (FZRR-2023-0007)","The research was carried out with the financial support of the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation within the framework of the project “Development of a mathematical model of chassis operation (transmission, chassis and control mechanisms) in static and dynamic states and creation of a digital twin of a passenger car platform on its basis” (code: FZRR-2023-0007).","Vilke V.G., Shapovalov I.L., Auto Oscillations in the Process of Car Braking, pp. 33-39, (2015); Svetlitsky V.A., Random Vibrations of Mechanical Systems, (1976); Kruchinin P.A., Magomedov M.K., Novozhilov I.V., Mathematical Model of an Automobile Wheel on Antiblock Motion Modes, pp. 63-69, (2001); Awrejcewicz J., Dzyubak L., Grebogi C., Estimation of Chaotic and Regular (Stick–Slip and Slip–Slip) Oscillations Exhibited by Coupled Oscillators with Dry Friction, Nonlinear Dyn, 42, pp. 383-394, (2015); Pascal M., Dynamics and Stability of a Two Degree of Freedom Oscillator with an Elastic Stop, J.

However, due to the openness and vulnerability of wireless networks, the participating vehicles in a VANET system are prone to a variety of cyberattacks. To secure the privacy of vehicles and assure the authenticity, integrity, and nonrepudiation of messages, numerous signature schemes have been employed in the literature on VANETs. The majority of these solutions, however, are either not fully secured or entail high computational costs. To address the above issues and to enable secure communication between the vehicle and the roadside unit (RSU), we propose a certificateless aggregate signature (CLAS) scheme based on hyperelliptic curve cryptography (HECC). This scheme enables participating vehicles to share their identities with trusted authorities via an open wireless channel without revealing their identities to unauthorized participants. Another advantage of this approach is its capacity to release the partial private key to participating devices via an open wireless channel while keeping its identity secret from any other third parties. A provable security analysis through the random oracle model (ROM), which relies on the hyperelliptic curve discrete logarithm problem, is performed, and we have proven that the proposed scheme is unforgeable against Type 1 ((Formula presented.)) and Type 2 ((Formula presented.)) forgers. The proposed scheme is compared with relevant schemes in terms of computational cost and communication overhead, and the results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is more efficient than the existing schemes in maintaining high-security levels. © 2023 by the authors.","certificateless aggregate signature; hyperelliptic curve cryptography; security; vehicular ad hoc network","Aggregates; Authentication; Geometry; Intelligent systems; Network security; Secure communication; Vehicle safety; Vehicle to vehicle communications; Aggregate signature; Certificateless; Certificateless aggregate signature; Computational costs; Hyperelliptic curve cryptographies; Intelligent transportation systems; Security; Signature Scheme; Vehicular Adhoc Networks (VANETs); Wireless channel; Vehicular ad hoc networks","","","","","","","Weber J.S., Neves M., Ferreto T., VANET simulators: An updated review, J.

Study Design: Experimental research design. Place and Duration of Study: A secondary school №60 (Russia Federation) within 4 months. Material and Methods: The study involved 120 school children who studied in the 3rd grade. Age 9-10 years. In both groups, we conducted a total of 34 physical education lessons during the study period. The usual physical education program was in the lessons of children from the control group, and in the experimental group, students additionally performed a 6-minute jog. We determined endurance by the Cooper test, and the ""Learn Words"" test determined the short-term memory of children. Results: After the study, the average endurance indicators of school children in the CG increased by 6.9-7.3% (p>0.05), and in the control group by 18.8.-24.8% (p<0.05). The short-term memory of schoolchildren in the CG improved by 4.9-8.9% (p>0.05), and in the EG the increase in indicators was 25.1-26.2% (p<0.05). Conclusion: In results of the experiment, it can be said that prolonged running has a beneficial effect on endurance and short-term memory of school children aged 9-10 years.

Carbon-based electrodes, with their characteristic high specific power and good cyclic stability, can be used for a new generation of consumer electronics, biomedical devices and hybrid electric vehicles. However, most carbon materials, due to their low electrical conductivity and insufficient diffusion of electrolyte ions in complex micropores, have energy density limitations in these devices due to insufficient number of pores for electrolyte diffusion. This work focuses on the optimization of a hybrid material based on porous carbon and carbon nanotubes by mechanical mixing. The purpose of this work is to gain new knowledge about the effect of hybrid material composition on its specific capacitance. The material for the study is taken on the basis of porous carbon and carbon nanotubes. Electrodes made of this hybrid material were taken as an object of research. Porous carbon or nitrogen-containing porous carbon (combined with single-, double-, or multi-layer carbon nanotubes (single-layer carbon nanotubes, bilayer carbon nanotubes or multilayer carbon nanotubes) were used to create the hybrid material. The effect of catalytic chemical vapor deposition synthesis parameters, such as flow rate and methane-to-hydrogen ratio, as well as the type of catalytic system on the multilayer carbon nanotubes structure was investigated. Two types of catalysts based on Mo12O28 (μ2-OH)12{Co(H2O)3}4 were prepared for the synthesis of multilayer carbon nanotubes by precipitation and combustion. The resulting carbon materials were tested as electrodes for supercapacitors and lithium ion intercalation. Electrodes based on nitrogen-containing porous carbon/carbon nanotubes 95:5% were found to be the most efficient compared to nitrogen-doped porous carbon by 10%. Carbon nanotubes, bilayer carbon nanotubes and multilayer carbon nanotubes synthesized using the catalyst obtained by deposition were selected as additives for the hybrid material. The hybrid materials were obtained by mechanical mixing and dispersion in an aqueous solution followed by lyophilization to remove water. When optimizing the ratio of the hybrid material components, the most effective porous carbon:carbon nanotubes component ratio was determined. © 2023 by the authors.","catalyst; electrodes; hybrid materials; lithium-ion battery; nanotubes","Catalysts; Chemical vapor deposition; Doping (additives); Electrodes; Electrolytes; Hybrid materials; Ions; Mixing; Multilayers; Nitrogen; Porous materials; Supercapacitor; Bi-layer; Carbon carbons; Carbon material; Carbon nano-tube structures; Hybrid electrodes; Hybrids material; Mechanical mixing; Multi-layer carbon nanotubes; Porous carbons; ]+ catalyst; Lithium-ion batteries","","","","","","","Chen C., Lee C.S., Tang Y., Fundamental Understanding and Optimization Strategies for Dual-Ion Batteries: A Review, Nano-Micro Lett, 15, (2023); Malozyomov B.V., Martyushev N.V., Sorokova S.N., Efremenkov E.A., Qi M., Mathematical Modeling of Mechanical Forces and Power Balance in Electromechanical Energy Converter, Mathematics, 11, (2023); Wei T., Lu J., Zhang P., Yang G., Sun C., Zhou Y., Zhuang Q., Tang Y., Metal–organic framework-derived Co3O4 modified nickel foam-based dendrite-free anode for robust lithium metal batteries, Chin.

The effective internal heat removal systems used to cool turbine blades lead to an increase in their thermal stress. Currently, the cracks induced by thermal fatigue are one of the common defects in the protective coatings on turbine blades. The heat resistance of the coatings at high temperatures is determined by the following three factors: the shape of the part onto which a coating is applied, the coating thickness, and the phase composition of the surface layers or the maximum aluminum content in the coating. Therefore, when a protective coating is chosen under specific operating conditions, it is important to know the influence of these factors on the heat resistance of the coating. In this work, we compare various coatings in terms of their resistance to cracking during cyclic temperature changes. The dependence of the heat resistance of the coatings on the method of their application and the phase-structural state is established. The revealed mechanism of thermal-fatigue crack formation and propagation as a function of the phase composition of the initial coating is especially valuable. The life of the protective coatings under cyclic temperature changes is shown to depend on the chemical composition of the coating and the method of its formation. The dependence of formation of thermal-fatigue cracks on samples with the coatings under study on the number of temperature change cycles is found. © Pleiades Publishing, Ltd. 2023.

On the basis of these studies polynomial models for estimating typical values of the ultimate strength at temperatures of 20–600°C are substantiated. Models for predicting the tensile strength of alloys at different operating temperatures depending upon aluminum and molybdenum equivalents are proposed. Generalized strength diagrams are constructed, which allow not only prediction of ultimate strength depending upon strength or structural equivalents, but also substantiation of optimum compositions of new alloys taking account of their operating condition requirements. © 2023, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","aluminum and molybdenum equivalents; property prediction; statistical studies; strength properties; test temperature; titanium alloys","Forecasting; Molybdenum; Statistics; Temperature distribution; Tensile strength; Titanium alloys; Alloy strength; Aluminum and molybdenum equivalent; Operating temperature; Property predictions; Statistical study; Strength property; Temperature dependence; Test temperatures; Titanium (alloys); Ultimate strength; Aluminum","","","","","","","A A., Egorova S.V., Skvartsova A.M., Mamonov N.A., Lavydenko L.V., Different forms of classification for different domestic titanium alloys,”, Titan, 2, 36, pp. 11-18, (2012); Fridlyander I.N., Senatorova O.G., Osintsev O.E., Engineering, Encyclopaedia, 2, 3, (2001); Kablov E.N., Aviation Materials, Ref: in 12, 6, (2010); Solonina O.P., Glazunov S.G., Heat-Resistant Titanium Alloys, (1976); Pol’kin, Titanium Alloys.

The microstructure and phase composition of the HECs were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electronic microscopy. Moreover, the mechanical properties were examined by nanoindentation. It is found that the as-prepared HEC contains the impurities of (Hf, Zr)O2 and amorphous carbon. The oxide and amorphous carbon can be in-situ removed by further carbothermal reduction reaction during the annealing, followed by dissolution of the reduction products into the HEC phase. In other words, the heat treatment can significantly improve the microstructure of the HEC by the removal of impurity and uniform distribution of the compositional elements. In addition, the annealing at 2000 °C and 2100 °C enhance the mechanical properties of the HEC. The nano-hardness, elastic modulus and fracture toughness are 34.04±1.49 GPa, 525.82±14.51 GPa and 3.60±0.55 MPa m1/2, respectively, for the HEC annealed at 2100 °C for 1 h, which are 1.13–2.08 times of the as-prepared HEC. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.","(Hf<sub>0.2</sub>Ta<sub>0.2</sub>Ti<sub>0.2</sub>Nb<sub>0.2</sub>Zr<sub>0.2</sub>)C; Annealing; Impurity; Mechanical properties; Microstructure","Amorphous carbon; Annealing; Carbothermal reduction; Ductile fracture; Entropy; Fracture toughness; Hafnium compounds; Spark plasma sintering; Tantalum compounds; Titanium compounds; Zirconium compounds; (hf0.2ta0.2ti0.2nb0.2zr0.2)C; Annealing; Electron transmission; Microstructural modification; Nano indentation; Reduction reaction; Self-propagation high-temperature synthesis; Spark-plasma-sintering; Transmission electronic microscopies; X- ray diffractions; Microstructure","","","","","Moscow Polytechnic University; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2022YFB3705400); Project 211, (BP0820014)","This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant No. 2022YFB3705400 ), and the Programme of Introducing Talents of Discipline to Universities (Grant No. BP0820014 ).

The advantages and disadvantages of cooling media are considered depending on the conditions of heat absorption. The influence of various compositions and concentrations of polymer aqueous solutions and mineral oil on the properties and structure of deformed vessels under cooling are studied. The possibility of varying the cooling media to regulate the cooling rate and properties of rolled products is shown.

In order to enable several intelligent IoT applications (i.e., indoor and outdoor), Federated Learning (FL) allows AI training at remote smart devices without the requirement for data sharing. First, with a discussion of the recent developments in FL and indoor smart device networks and their integration, we present a thorough assessment of the growing applications of FL in indoor networks. Next, we investigate and evaluate FL's potential for allowing various indoor applications and services, such as data sharing, localization, navigation, human activity recognition, and security and privacy. FL in numerous critical indoor services and applications, including smart manufacturing, smart homes, and smart healthcare, is then thoroughly discussed.

The studies were carried out during the turning of steel with subsequent investigation of the wear area using scanning (SEM) and transmission (TEM) microscopes. Although the main parameters (elemental composition and structure) are identical and the values of hardness and elastic modulus are close, tools with the coatings under consideration demonstrated noticeable difference in wear resistance. The (Mo,Y,Al)N coated tool had a wear resistance 45% higher than the (Cr,Y,Al)N coated tool and 30% higher than the (Ti,Cr,Al)N reference coated tool. Active formation of cracks is detected in the (Cr,Y,Al)N coating, while oxidation wear dominated in the (Mo,Y,Al)N coating. Therefore, coatings containing layers of materials characterized by an increased tendency to oxidize, but at the same time providing a favorable compositional effect, can be effectively used. This is possible provided that the oxidation-resistant layers protect the oxidation-prone layers from active contact with oxygen. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Metal cutting; Nanostructured coatings; Oxidation; Tool wear; Yttrium nitride","Aluminum coatings; Ductile fracture; Oxidation; Oxidation resistance; Turning; Wear resistance; Yttrium compounds; Coated tools; Cr-Al-N; Elemental compositions; Hardness and elastic modulus; High-content; Main parameters; Nanolayer coating; Nanostructured coatings; Oxidation wear; Tool wear; Metal cutting","","","","","Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation, Minobrnauka, (GK 075-15-2021-696); Russian Science Foundation, RSF, (21-79-30058)","Funding text 1: The study was supported by a grant from the Russian Science Foundation (project No. 21-79-30058). ; Funding text 2: Authors conducted the studies using the equipment of the Center of collective use of MSTU “ STANKIN ” (agreement No. 075-15-2021-695 , 26/07/2021).

Hot deformation was carried out by the uniaxial compression of cylindrical specimens on a Gleeble 3800 thermomechanical simulator. A dependence is obtained for calculating the kinetics of austenite grain growth for a temperature range of 1150–1250 °C. The proposed dependence makes it possible to evaluate grain growth under non-isothermal conditions. The verification of the adequacy of the proposed dependence and the method for calculating the grain size at cooling rates 0.2, 1 and 5 °C/s showed its high convergence. The difference between the calculated and experimental grain size did not exceed 8%. The suppression of grain growth is due to the precipitation of titanium carbides and carbonitrides. Using the developed grain growth model, an analysis was made of the reasons for the formation of large grains in the shell after the elongating in the production process. © 2023 by the authors.","AISI 321; austenitic stainless steel; grain growth kinetics; hot deformation; pipe rolling","","","","","","","","Arroyo B., Lacalle R., Alvarez J.A., Cicero S., Moreno-Ventas X., Analysis of Unexpected Leaks in AISI 316L Stainless Steel Pipes Used for Water Conduction in a Port Area, Appl.

The model implemented the Monte Carlo technique to simulate the beam propagation through a scattering layer, a ray-tracing technique to propagate the scattered beam to the measurements plane, and the Shack–Hartmann technique to calculate the scattered laser beam distortions. The results obtained from the developed model were confirmed during the laboratory experiment. Both the numerical model and laboratory experiment showed that with an increase of the concentration value of scattering particles in the range from 105 to 106 mm−3, the amplitude of distortions of laser beam propagated through the layer of the scattering medium increases exponentially. © 2023 by the authors.","adaptive optics; geometrical optics; hybrid algorithm; Monte Carlo simulation; ray-tracing algorithm; scattered laser beam; scattering medium; Shack–Hartmann sensor","Adaptive optics; Intelligent systems; Monte Carlo methods; Ray tracing; Hybrid algorithms; Hybrid model; Laboratory experiments; Laser beam distortion; Monte Carlo's simulation; Ray-tracing algorithm; Scattered laser beam; Scattering medium; Shack-Hartmann sensor; Shack-Hartmann techniques; Laser beams","","","","","Russian Science Foundation, RSF, (20-19-00597)","This research was funded by the Russian Science Foundation, Grant No. 20-19-00597.","Berrocal E., Sedarsky D., Paciaroni M., Meglinski I., Linne M., Laser light scattering in turbid media Part I: Experimental and simulated results for the spatial intensity distribution, Opt.

The relaxation dynamics of the excited states corresponding to these transitions was studied. The chromaticity coordinates and dominant wavelengths are calculated for ultrathin CdSe nanoscrolls.

The substrates were of a cylindrical axial tool model with a size ratio: d = 12 mm to l = 75 mm. An original tool holder made of molybdenum, in the form of a sector of the excessive ring with the axis of the hole parallel to the central conductive platform, protects part of the substrate from heating due to the edge effect of plasma. The uniformity of heating of the growth part, which is located inside the excessive ring, is calculated using mathematical modeling and is provided by rotation at a speed of at least 12 rpm, which ensures the uniformity of the coating. The average grain size of the nanocrystalline film measured along the cylinder forming was 41 nm. © 2023 by the authors.","chemical vapor deposition; diamond; microwave plasma; multi-layered films; tungsten carbide axial tool model","","","","","","Russian Science Foundation, RSF, (22-19-00694)","This research was carried out at the expense of the grant of the Russian Science Foundation No. 22-19-00694.","Gielisse P.J., Mechanical properties of diamond, diamond films, diamond-like carbon and diamond materials, Handbook of Industrial Diamonds and Diamond Films, pp. 49-89, (1998); Tillmann W., Trends and market perspectives for diamond tools in the construction industry, Int.

The first method employed in quantum electrodynamics consists in calculating the energy of the electron placed in a constant magnetic field, the extra energy due to the field being proportional to the magnetic moment. It is also possible to use the second method proceeding from the fact that the asymptotic form of the vector potential at infinity is proportional to the magnetic moment. If the electron were point-like, both the methods would yield identical results. In the present paper is studied the magnetic field created by the electron in hydrogen-like ions, which enables one to find the electron magnetic moment by the second method. The electron magnetic moment in this case proves to be different in different states of the electron in the Coulomb field of the ions and, moreover, is distinct from the magnetic moment calculated by the first method. The results of the paper show that the electron is not small and is deformable under action of external fields. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Dirac equation; Electron magnetic moment; Quantum electrodynamics; Vector potential","","","","","","","","Landau L.D., Lifshitz E.M., The Classical Theory of Fields, (2000); Berestetskii V.B., Lifshitz E.M., Pitaevskii L.P., Quantum Electrodynamics, (1982); Landau L.D., Lifshitz E.M., Quantum Mechanics, (2000); Greiner W., Muller B., Rafelski J., Quantum Electrodynamics of Strong Fields, (1985); Wichmann E.H., Kroll N.M., Phys.

It was determined that the parameters of hatching mode affect the roughness of the lateral surface when building samples with vertical walls. It was shown that the average height of surface roughness, Rz, increases as the energy of hatching mode is intensified. A physical model was proposed to describe the effect of parameters of hatching mode on the roughness of vertical walls, which is based on the hypothesis that a melt microflow can penetrate during hatching onto the external surface of the contour. It was demonstrated that the distribution of surface roughness values of vertical walls is non-Gaussian, and the curves are typically right-skewed (the mode is located to the left of the center of size grouping), which indicates the influence of non-random factors whose number or values systematically change over time. © 2023, Allerton Press, Inc.","additive technologies; electron beam melting; roughness of vertical walls; titanium alloy products","3D printing; Additives; Electron beam melting; Electron beams; Titanium alloys; Walls (structural partitions); Additive technology; Condition; Electron-beam melting; Micro geometry; Roughness of vertical wall; Selective electron beam melting; Statistical study; Titania alloy product; Titanium (alloys); Vertical wall; Surface roughness","","","","","","","Korner C., Additive manufacturing of metallic components by selective electron beam melting—a review, Int.

Among these applications is superpixel segmentation, in which geodesic distances from the center of specified segments to an arbitrary image point are calculated. Meanwhile, the algorithms proposed so far for calculating such distances in segmentation problems have been heuristic, iterative approaches, which do not guarantee the expected result. In this study, a new fast algorithm for calculating the geodesic distance is proposed, which is proven to be accurate. The image segments obtained using this algorithm are simply connected regions. The algorithm yields simply connected superpixels at the output, in contrast to many other approaches based on the spatial proximity of the geodesic distance and requiring an additional correction. The proposed technique surpasses its analogs in the border recognition efficiency and computational speed. © Pleiades Publishing, Inc. 2023.

One of the most important issues to ensure the successful adaptation of young professionals in the labor market is to increase their professional loyalty. Loyalty is based on both the employee's satisfaction with the chosen place of work, the organization of work activities, and the value attitude to the chosen profession. The loyalty of young professionals is largely determined by the professional environment, which ensures the inclusion of young people in the profession and is based on the establishment of long-term relationships. The purpose of the study is to substantiate the loyalty of young specialists as a factor in the development of the professional environment on the example of pedagogical universities. Materials and methods. The study is based on the results of an online survey of young specialists of pedagogical universities of the CIS member states in the number of 1,285 people; the study of publications of individual authors, a review of the results of sociological research conducted by sociological organizations VTSIOM-Sputnik, ISPI RAS, etc. Data processing was carried out using the IBM SPSS Statistics and Microsoft Excel application software package. A descriptive method was used, the basis of which is represented by a descriptive methodology that allows quantitative explanation of the data obtained. The results of the study. The loyalty of young professionals is a complex characteristic that captures their positive attitude to their work, place of work, corporate culture, willingness to work in an organization and is determined by long-term relationships between subjects of social interaction and other aspects of the professional environment. The highest level of professional loyalty (from 6 points and above on a ten–point scale; the eNPS index for an organization from 30 to 100) is manifested in young professionals who focus on commitment and trust in the organization (a positive balance of ""satisfied – dissatisfied"" ratings – more than 50%), the team (80%), as well as on job satisfaction (73%). Such positions form the value attitude of a young employee and allow him to form not only his actual behavior, but also a higher perception of the value brand of the organization, therefore, interest in the results of work (the balance of assessments of professional growth prospects is 52%). Conclusion. The adaptation of young professionals in the labor market and the results of their work largely depend on how ready they are to perform their work and how successfully they are included in the professional environment. This process is assessed by the degree of professional loyalty of young professionals, as well as the responsibility of social partners to form a professional position of the individual. © 2023 LLC Ecological Help.

The effect of the Si- and Ca-alloying elements in aluminum on the growth process, morphology, composition, mechanical, and corrosion properties of the PEO coatings was investigated. Uniform coatings with a minimum number of defects were formed on the surfaces of Al–Ca alloys. Increasing the Si content in Al led to an increase in the bulk and surface porosity of the coatings. The α-Al2O3 phase mainly formed in the coatings synthesized on pure Al and Al–Ca alloys, while an increased amount of Si in Al alloys hindered the formation of the α-Al2O3 phase. The coatings had a microhardness of 660–1180 HV, which was 20–30 times higher than that of the original as-cast alloy. Moreover, the coating on the Al–Ca alloys had the highest peak hardness, which was probably caused by the formation of a greater amount of the α-Al2O3 phase. Electrochemical studies in 3.5% NaCl have shown that PEO coatings reduce the corrosion current density. Of all PEO-treated alloys, Al and Al1Ca have the lowest corrosion current density and hence the highest corrosion resistance due to the composition and uniformity of the coating. © 2023 by the authors.","Al alloys; casting alloys; coatings; corrosion resistance; microhardness; microstructure; plasma electrolytic oxidation (PEO); XRD analysis","","","","","","Moscow Polytechnic University; Russian Science Foundation, RSF, (22-79-00179)","This work was financially supported by the Moscow Polytechnic University within the framework of the grant named after Pyotr Kapitsa (SEM, EMPA, XRD, HV) and by the Russian Science Foundation, grant number 22-79-00179 (electrochemical behavior).","Polmear I., Light Alloys: From Traditional Alloys to Nanocrystals, pp. 216-226, (2006); Belov N.A., Naumova E.A., Akopyan T.K., Aluminium-Based Eutectic Alloys: New Alloying Systems, pp. 191-235, (2016); Akopyan T.K., Letyagin N.V., Avxentieva N.N., High-tech alloys based on Al-Ca-La(-Mn) eutectic system for casting, metal forming and selective laser melting, Non Ferr.

It consists of a mixture of carbohydrates, mainly glycoproteins and proteoglycans. Due to its structure and sensitivity to environmental conditions, it represents a complicated object to investigate. Here, we review studies of the glycocalyx conducted using scanning probe microscopy approaches. This includes imaging techniques as well as the measurement of nanomechanical properties. The nanomechanics of the glycocalyx is particularly important since it is widely present on the surfaces of mechanosensitive cells such as endothelial cells. An overview of problems with the interpretation of indirect data via the use of analytical models is presented. Special insight is given into changes in glycocalyx properties during pathological processes. The biological background and alternative research methods are briefly covered. © 2023 by the authors.","atomic force nanoindentation; cell nanomechanics; glycocalyx; scanning probe microscopy","Endothelial Cells; Glycocalyx; Microscopy, Atomic Force; Microscopy, Scanning Probe; Proteoglycans; acetylsalicylic acid; carbohydrate; chondroitin sulfate; glycoprotein; proteoglycan; A-375 cell line; atomic force microscopy; confocal microscopy; endothelium cell; Escherichia coli; finite element analysis; glycocalyx; human; mechanotransduction; melanoma; molecular mechanics; optical coherence tomography; PC12 cell line (pheochromocytoma); Review; scanning electron microscopy; scanning probe microscopy; signal transduction; umbilical vein endothelial cell; endothelium cell; metabolism; procedures; scanning probe microscopy","","acetylsalicylic acid, 493-53-8, 50-78-2, 53663-74-4, 53664-49-6, 63781-77-1; chondroitin sulfate, 9007-28-7, 9082-07-9; Proteoglycans, ","","","Institute of General Pathology and Pathophysiology, (FGFU-2022-0006); Moscow Polytechnic University; Pyotr Kapitsa","This work was financially supported by Moscow Polytechnic University within the framework of the grant named after Pyotr Kapitsa and the state assignment of the Institute of General Pathology and Pathophysiology (state task no.

Disturbance of chemical signaling is accompanied by several diseases such as ischemia, trauma, and neurodegenerative diseases. It is known that the disturbance of chemical signaling, like that caused by glutamate excitotoxicity, leads to the structural reorganization of the cytoskeleton of neuronal cells and the deviation of native mechanical properties. Thus, to investigate the mechanical properties of living neuronal cells in the presence of glutamate, it is crucial to use noncontact and low-stress methods, which are the advantages of scanning ion-conductance microscopy (SICM). Moreover, a nanopipette may be used for the local delivery of small molecules as well as for a probe. In this work, SICM was used as an advanced technique for the simultaneous local delivery of glutamate and investigation of living neuronal cell morphology and mechanical behavior caused by an excitotoxic effect of glutamate. © 2023 by the authors.","cell biomechanics; local delivery; nanopipette; neuronal cells; scanning ion-conductance microscopy; scanning probe microscopy","Glutamic Acid; Ions; Microscopy; Neurons; capsaicin; glutamic acid; n methyl dextro aspartic acid receptor; glutamic acid; ion; animal cell; Article; biomechanics; calcium transport; cell adhesion; cell migration; cell structure; confocal microscopy; controlled study; degenerative disease; dendrite; excitotoxicity; glia cell; hippocampal neuronal culture; ion conductance; live cell imaging; nerve cell; neurotransmission; nonhuman; rat; scanning electron microscopy; Young modulus; microscopy; nerve cell; procedures","","capsaicin, 404-86-4; glutamic acid, 11070-68-1, 138-15-8, 56-86-0, 6899-05-4; Glutamic Acid, ; Ions, ","","","Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, MEXT; Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation, Minobrnauka, (075-15-2022-264)","The study was performed employing a unique scientific facility “Scanning ion-conductance microscope with a confocal module” (registration number 2512530) and was financially supported by the Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation, Agreement No. 075-15-2022-264.

Aanelasticity caused by structural transitions were studied using temperature-, time-, and amplitude-dependent tests. The sample subjected to compression combined with torsion demonstrates a much higher thermodynamical stimulus for recrystallization and higher dislocation density, consequently it exhibits a more rapid decrease in dislocation density both at instant heating and isothermal annealing. Avrami's kinetics parameters for the isothermal recrystallization process and activation parameters for grain boundary relaxation in the samples after recrystallization are calculated. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Al-Mg alloy; Anelasticity; Avrami parameters; Recrystallization","Binary alloys; Grain boundaries; Isotherms; Magnesium alloys; Recrystallization (metallurgy); Torsional stress; Anelasticity; Avrami parameter; Different treatments; Flat dies; High dislocation density; Recrystallisation; Simple compressions; Structural transitions; Temperature amplitude; Thermodynamical; Aluminum alloys","","","","","","","Zhilyaev A.P., Langdon T.G., Prog.

The simulation model of the electric all-wheel drive vehicle is carried out in the Simcenter Amesim environment to account for the dynamic characteristics and features of the vehicle. The simulation model was developed based on the drawn requirements while the assumptions were justified. Inertia characteristics, tire characteristics, suspension elements, grip characteristics, and surface and air resistance were considered, as these factors affect the vehicle longitudinal and transverse dynamics. The article presents the model implemented in the “Labcar” system and confirms its adequacy by comparing it with the data obtained during the full-scale prototype tests. The bench and range tests of a test vehicle with electric transmission equipped with a measuring complex confirmed the adequacy of the developed model. The results of comparative tests allow for the conclusion that the developed model complex is suitable for modeling purposes, including studying, debugging and initial calibrations of the algorithm of torque distribution on the driving axles of all-wheel drive electric vehicle. © 2023 by the authors.","course stability; electric vehicle; HiL; MiL; simulation model","All wheel drive vehicles; Electric traction; Electric vehicles; Magnetic levitation vehicles; Program debugging; Traction motors; Vehicle transmissions; Vehicle wheels; Virtual reality; All-wheel drives; Course stability; Curvilinear motion; Developed model; Distribution algorithms; Drive simulation; HiL; MiL; Simulation model; Torque distribution; Digital storage","","","","","Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation, Minobrnauka, (FZRR-2023-0007)","The research was carried out with the financial support of the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation within the framework of the project “Development of a mathematical model of chassis operation (transmission, chassis and control mechanisms) in static and dynamic states and creation of a digital twin of a passenger car platform on its basis” (code: FZRR-2023-0007).","De Novellis L., Sorniotti A., Gruber P., Shead L., Ivanov V., Hoepping K., Torque Vectoring for Electric Vehicles with Indi-vidually Controlled Motors: State-of-the-Art and Future Developments, World Electr.

The object of study is a wall with FHIC, on the outer surface of which temperature sensors were mounted and measurements were taken. Air temperatures were also measured for one month of the warm period of the year. The coefficient of absorption of solar radiation by the surface of the facade is calculated based on the measurement of the spectral reflection coefficient. Measurements of direct and scattered solar radiation arriving on a horizontal surface were carried out, and the cloudiness of the sky was also recorded. The calculation of direct and scattered solar radiation was carried out, taking into account the shading of surrounding buildings using the authors’ novel methods. The experimental days were divided into three groups according to the degree of cloudiness; statistically significant differences between the groups for the studied parameters were demonstrated. The temperature of the outer surface of the wall was calculated according to A.M. Shklover’s formula. The measured values of the temperature of the outer surface of the wall were compared with the calculated ones. It was shown that there is a good correlation between the measured and calculated temperatures for different degrees of cloudiness. At the same time, for days with no or slight cloudiness (Group I), when direct solar radiation predominates, the differences reach 1.7 °C; smaller differences are observed for days with average cloudiness (Group II) during daytime hours, with a maximum difference of 0.5 °C; and on days with continuous cloudiness (Group III), when only scattered radiation is present for daytime hours, the maximum difference is 0.3 °C. Statistically significant differences were found between the measured and calculated temperatures for groups of days, divided by the degree of cloudiness, for the experimental period of a day from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., which indicates the possibility of considering amendments to A.M. Shklover’s formula for sunny days. The results of comparing the measured and calculated heating temperatures of the facade surface also indirectly confirm the correctness of the author’s calculations of the incoming solar radiation, taking into account the effect of the surrounding buildings. The results obtained can be used to study the inertia and durability of building structures under solar radiation. © 2023 by the authors.","absorption of solar radiation; degree of cloudiness; energy saving; heating temperature; solar radiation","Atmospheric temperature; Clouds; Energy conservation; Facades; Plaster; Solar radiation; Walls (structural partitions); Absorption of solar radiation; Degree of cloudiness; Direct solar radiation; Energy  savings; Energy-savings; Heating temperatures; Measurements of; Outer surface; Scattered solar radiation; Surrounding buildings; Heating temperature","","","","","","","Gagarin V.G., Korkina E.V., Shmarov I.A., Heat Gain and Heat Loss through Glazing with High Thermal Properties, Academia Archit.

One way to solve these problems is to develop original packaging with protection elements and labeling against counterfeiting, which excludes the possibility of replication and forgery by printing or other methods. The most reliable way to protect packaging from counterfeiting is the use of new materials with unique optical properties and constantly updated technologies for packaging manufacturing and labeling. This paper proposes a new multi-level technology for the design, manufacture and hidden labeling of polymer packaging made from several layers of transparent polymer films. The design and marking of the multilayer films are combined with perforation, thermal treatment and heat sealing of the package. The reliability of the proposed markings is based on the characterization of optical pleochroism effects in transparent multilayer polymer materials with shape memory. The thermomechanical and optical properties of films made of bulk thermoplastics (polypropylene, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride and polyethylene) were characterized in polarized light. The modification and combination of these films provide a high color difference and sufficient contrast of hidden markings, allowing to identify genuine products by bar codes formed from shape memory films in sealing seams of flexible polymer packaging. © 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","color difference; dichroism; differential scanning calorimetry; film lamination; hidden barcode on the package; pleochroism; polarized light; shape memory film; spectrophotometry; thermoplastic polymers","Chlorine compounds; Color; Colorimetry; Differential scanning calorimetry; Fiber optic sensors; Food products; Light polarization; Liquid crystal polymers; Multilayer films; Multilayers; Packaging machines; Packaging materials; Plastic films; Polymer films; Polypropylenes; Reinforced plastics; Color difference; Film lamination; Hidden barcode on the package; Labelings; Multilevels; Pleochroism; Polymer packaging; Shape memory polymers; Shape-memory films; Thermoplastic polymer; Packaging","","","","","Moscow Polytechnic University","This work was supported by the Moscow Polytechnic University within the grant named after Vladimir Fortov.

The paper describes the failure and degradation models of complex technical systems assuming monotonic and non-monotonic diffusion distributions, as well as a failure and degradation model of these systems assuming a three-parameter diffusion distribution. Failure and degradation models are proposed to be used together with the classical model of E. Sychev and more complex models created on its basis. In addition, a set of models representing the operation of complex technical systems was developed. The first model is designed for systems whose service life is fully recovered during repair and is described by a system of 21st-order linear algebraic equations, with four degrees (groups) of system degradation taken into account. A functional dependence of steady-state availability on the verification intervals of measuring instruments is plotted for complex technical systems from different degradation groups. Described by a system of 24th-order linear algebraic equations, the second operation model of complex technical systems, whose service life cannot be fully recovered during repair, enables the representation of the main stages in the lifecycle of a pool of complex technical systems, which includes pool upgrade through the procurement of new and modernization of existing systems. The developed operation models provide a means to calculate the optimal intervals between verifications and tolerances for the monitored parameters in different degradation groups of complex technical systems, thus ensuring maximum steady-state availability. These models can be used to classify complex technical systems in order to establish requirements for their metrological support, as well as to calculate technical and economic development indicators for a pool of such systems. The proposed models also provide the basis for a set of applied programs designed to model and optimize stages in its lifecycle. © 2023, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","78.21.35; Complex technical system; Degradation; Metrological support; Operation model","Lakes; Linear equations; Repair; Service life; 78.21.35; Complex technical systems; Degradation model; Diffusion distribution; Failure modelling; Linear algebraic equation; Metrological supports; Monotonics; Operations Modeling; Steady-state availability; Linear algebra","","","","","","","Volkov L.I., Upravlenie Ekspluataciey Letatelnyh Kompleksov [in Russian], (1981); Sychev E.I., Metrologicheskoe Obespechenie Radioelektronnoj Apparatury (Metody Analiza) [in Russian], (1994); Mishchenko V.I., Jevoljucija modelej processa jekspluatacii, Vestn.

The complex technology for processing lithium-cobalt current sources (LCCS), developed at the National Research Center Kurchatov Institute, is described, including the stages of discharge, opening in an inert atmosphere, crushing, grinding (with mechanical activation), and leaching with extraction. The data from additional studies on the alkaline leaching process of the LCCS cathode are presented. In this case, the degree of aluminum extraction from the LCCS cathode reached 94.2%. Data on a comprehensive study of the distribution of metal components in fractions after grinding and milling in blade and ball mills were analyzed. The results showed that Co, Li compounds, and graphite are contained in powders of size 50–1000 pm, and fractions of size 1000–2500 pm contain Cu, Al compounds, and polymer particles. A fractional (staged) technology is proposed for separating valuable metal components from LCCS with water separation and leaching. The results of leaching mechanically activated powders with inorganic acids are presented. A comparative analysis of the results obtained with data from international authors on the efficiency of LCCS leaching was performed, and a mathematical description of the process kinetics was proposed. A modernized block diagram of combined mechanical processes with leaching and extraction processes was developed. © 2023, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","ball mill; blade mill; cobalt and lithium compounds; complex recycling methods; hydrometallurgy; kinetics; leaching; lithium-cobalt current sources; mechanical activation; porosity; pyrometallurgy; recovery efficiency; recycling technology; specific surface area","Alkalinity; Aluminum compounds; Cathodes; Chemical activation; Cobalt compounds; Copper compounds; Efficiency; Electronic Waste; Extraction; Grinding (machining); Hydrometallurgy; Lithium compounds; Particle size analysis; Powder metals; Recycling; Blade mill; Complex recycling method; Current sources; Leaching process; Lithium-cobalt current source; Mechanical activation; Metal components; Recovery efficiency; Recycling methods; Recycling technology; Leaching","","","","","Russian Science Foundation, RSF, (21-19-00403); National Research Center ""Kurchatov Institute"", NRC KI","Funding text 1: The research was conducted within the Russian Science Foundation (RSF) scientific grant No. 21-19-00403, “Study of the processes of mechanochemical destruction of cathode materials during the extraction of cobalt and its compounds.”; Funding text 2: Analytical studies were performed using the scientific equipment of the Center for Collective Usage Research Chemical Analytical Center of the National Research Center Kurchatov Institute.","Huang B., Pan Z., Su X., An L., Recycling of lithium-ion batteries: Recent advances and perspectives, J.

Ceramic samples were prepared by sintering powders obtained by grinding melted solid solutions of the same composition. A comparative analysis of the obtained data with similar characteristics of single crystals has been carried out. Differences in the phase composition of ceramics and initial single crystals were found. The effect of the structure and properties of grain boundaries on the ionic conductivity of ceramic samples is discussed. It is shown that the differences in the ionic conductivity of ceramic samples and crystals are mainly due to changes in the structure and phase composition. © 2023 by the authors.","conductivity; single crystal; SOFC; structure; zirconia membranes","Crystal structure; Grain boundaries; Ionic conductivity; Membranes; Phase composition; Powders; Sintering; Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC); Solid solutions; Zirconia; Ceramic samples; Comparative analyzes; Conductivity; Electrolytics; Luminescent characteristics; Material-based; Stabilized solid solutions; Structure and physical properties; Structures and properties; Zirconia membrane; Single crystals","","","","","Moscow Polytechnic University; Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation, Minobrnauka, (GK 075-15-2021-696)","Funding text 1: This work was financially supported by the Moscow Polytechnic University within the framework of the grant named after Pyotr Kapitsa.

Zabelin (1820–1908). The works of a scientist on history and archeology are known in historiography, while the historian's views on Russian literature and its teaching are being considered for the first time. For modern teachers, the appeal to the ""Course of Russian Literature"", which is stored in the archive of the scientist, allows them to understand the civic essence of teaching literature, the authors introduce archival materials into scientific circulation, uses the diary entries of the scientist and the memories of his students. The pedagogical activity of I.E. Zabelin falls on the years 1853–1869, when the concept of teaching literature was just being developed. The scientist worked at the Konstantinovsky Land Survey Institute and the School of Topographers in an era of heated discussions about the future of the Russian education system. Documents show that I.E. Zabelin stood outside the political forces of that time, but his pedagogical views were clearly progressive, echoed the ideas of the founder of Russian pedagogy K.D. Ushinsky (1823–1871). Zabelin taught to love and understand the ideas and aspirations of his people, and for him the concept of ""nationality"" permeates the entire course. The teacher aimed to educate students in love with the Russian word, instilled a culture of thinking and expressing their thoughts. The attention of the scientist to reading, the real anthem of which contains a course of literature, the awareness of the need for a sober assessment of the political situation sounds relevant today. I.E. Zabelin applied advanced scientific methods, used progressive textbooks and anthologies. He interpreted only recently discovered literary monuments, was aware of the latest achievements in literary studies. The depth and value of his course is given by scientists' understanding of the unity of historical and literary knowledge, attention to the theoretical foundations of both sciences, philosophy of knowledge in general. I.E. Zabelin developed the author's ""Course of Russian Literature"" based on literary sources, realized the need for a teacher's conversation with students, which would awaken thought, involve the whole class in work, form a civic position among students. Both historical disciplines and literature I.E. Zabelin taught in a fascinating and emotional way, his lectures were remembered by students for many years. The personality of I.E. Zabelin, who brilliantly combined the traits of both a scientist and a teacher, who saw the need not only to teach the subject, but also to educate the younger generation, is a worthy example for our contemporaries.

The objective is to investigate and evaluate the existing institutional forms of state support for small agricultural businesses. Methods: The research uses a comprehensive approach to analyze small agricultural businesses, incorporating a SWOT analysis to identify their strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. Results: The study establishes that key production forces are concentrated in the hands of large-and medium-sized private enterprises manufacturing agricultural products. The authors analyze the forms of state support for small agricultural businesses. They also consider the functioning of small business entities in the agro-industrial complex. An original interpretation of the model of state regulation of agriculture is presented, including its goals, methods, and tools. Conclusion: Based on the analysis of existing institutional mechanisms of state support for small forms of agricultural businesses, the feasibility of using additional forms is substantiated, which, in the context of growing economic sanctions, will allow small agricultural businesses to overcome the shortage of financial resources and quickly respond to force majeure. To increase general sustainability and the sustainability of small agricultural enterprises, this study recommends introducing additional forms of government support. © 2023, Centro Universitario Curitiba - UNICURITIBA.

Ingots of the alloy of the chosen composition and the hot and cold rolled sheets obtained from them were used as objects for the experimental study. Based on microstructural studies, it is shown that calcium binds iron into compact inclusions (presumably, into the Al10CaFe2 phases), which has a positive effect on the mechanical properties of the alloy, as well as on the technological plasticity during the rolling operation. Zirconium and scandium additives make it possible to form thermally stable nanoparticles of the Al3(Zr, Sc)–L12 phase, which is favorable for maintaining a partially unrecrystallized structure in cold rolled sheets during annealing at least up to 400°C. Using the alloy of the selected composition as an example, the fundamental possibility for producing sheet products from cast (unhomogenized) ingots with the properties of thermally hardenable alloys of the Al–Si–Mg–Mn and Al–Zn–(4.5)Mg–(1.5)Mn types without using quenching has been demonstrated. © 2023, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","aluminum–magnesium alloys; mechanical properties; microstructure; phase composition; rolled sheets","Additives; Aluminum; Aluminum alloys; Calcium alloys; Ingots; Iron alloys; Magnesium; Magnesium alloys; Scandium; Zirconium; Aluminum - Magnesium alloys; Cold-rolled sheets; Fe-base alloy; Hot rolled sheets; Micro-structural; Multicomponents; Rolled sheets; Rolling operations; Thermally stable; Zirconium additives; Calcium","","","","","Moscow Polytechnic University; Russian Science Foundation, RSF","This study was supported by grant no. 21-79-00134 from the Russian Science Foundation (casting of ingots, deformation processing, and SEM imaging) and by a Kapitza grant from the Moscow Polytechnic University within the framework of State program Priority 2030 (thermal treatment, and OM and SEM imaging).

Models were built using the SolidWorks software package. Simulation modeling of the work of such elements is carried out on the ANSYS Workbench platform using the transient thermal module for non-stationary thermal calculations. This made it possible to estimate the power of the heat flows arising at the inputs of the logic gate because of heating by 2 ℃. For the design under consideration, during the virtual experiment equal to 1 s, the power of the heat flux after 0.01 s was 7е+5 pW/µm2, which is sufficient to transfer heat to the output of the logic gate. The required voltage of 2.5 V for heating and setting the output value is comparable to the same parameter for memristors based on CaTiO3 perovskites, a rare earth element. The thermal memory elements used are based on the Al-Si-SiO2 structure, which is more cost-effective and suitable for integration with current ICs. This article provides a table comparing different types of analog memory. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the possibility of using the thermal memory element design we developed to create logic gates as part of global research aimed at developing the architecture of in-memory computing. Thermal analogues of logic gates open the way to the implementation of thermal interaction circuits in artificial neural networks. © 2023, International Organization on 'Technical and Physical Problems of Engineering'.

It was found that the supramolecular structure of the films is a three-dimensional network composed of orientationally ordered microfibrils with an average diameter from 30 to 60 nm, which consist of crystalline and amorphous regions. An analysis of the powder X-ray diffraction patterns demonstrated that the crystalline regions of microfibrils are formed by cellulose I. Depending on the composition of the nutrient medium, the degree of crystallinity of the films varies in the range from ~20 to 90%. It was found that, regardless of the carbon source, the top and bottom surfaces of BC films have different microstructures defined by static conditions of cultivation. Thus, the top surface of gel films contains pores with a diameter of up to 500 nm, whereas a wider pore size distribution (up to 600 nm) is observed on the bottom surface. The difference between the average pore sizes on the top and bottom surfaces varies from 95 to 180 nm and from 100 to 200 nm, respectively. The measurements of the mechanical properties of the films showed that the films produced by the cultivation on media containing fructose and sucrose have the maximum strength, whereas the films produced using lactose and maltose have the minimum strength. The data on the BC productivity of the GH-1/2008 strain were obtained. © 2023, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.","","Carbon; Cellulose; Crystallinity; Fructose; Glucose; Maltose; Carbon; Carbon films; Cellulose; Crystallinity; Fructose; Glucose; Maltose; Microstructure; Pore size; Sugar (sucrose); Bacterial cellulose; Bottom surfaces; Crystalline regions; Different carbon sources; Gel films; Gluconacetobacter hansenii; Microfibril; Nutrient media; Static conditions; Top surface; Cellulose films","","","","","Russian Academy of Sciences, РАН; Russian Science Foundation, RSF, (23-29-00952)","The study was financially supported by the Russian Science Foundation (grant no. 23-29-00952) using the equipment of the Collaborative Access Center of the Federal Scientific Research Centre “Crystallography and Photonics” of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

The study used a mixed-methods approach with qualitative analysis of literature from Russia, Serbia, Spain, and Indonesia, and a research questionnaire was developed. 1595 participants were recruited for a survey determining their experiences of learning English and students’ perspectives on English teaching methods in non-English speaking countries. The data went through thematic analysis in the qualitative part of the research and descriptive analysis in the quantitative survey-based design. Findings of the qualitative analysis revealed both advantages and disadvantages of teaching English to students in selected countries; however, the main findings reported the presence of cultural barriers and students finding it difficult to form meanings from the English language context. Conceptual thinking helped to understand the role of memory and comprehension when learning a foreign language, whereby research focuses on more novel concepts. Future researchers can focus on the area of neural development of students' memory, which can help guide strategies to teach the English language effectively. © 2023 by the authors.

Each of these elements is simulated separately. Since all these models form a single system (ship), they are interdependent. The operating modes of some systems influence others, but at the same time, the work of all the systems should be aimed at fulfilling the basic functions of the ship. The work proposes a methodological approach to combining various systems of ships into a single complex model. This model allows combining models of ship systems of various levels (microlevel, macrolevel, metalevel, megalevel). The work provides examples of models of such multi-level energy systems. These are energy systems composed of an electric generator, a diesel engine, a propeller shaft, and algorithms used for operating the common parts of the ship’s electric power system and a piston wear process. Analytical, structural, numerical, and object-oriented models were made for these objects. Each of these particular models describes a limited class of problems, has characteristic properties, and a mathematical structure. The work shows how particular models can be interconnected using a set-theoretic description. Particular models are combined into macrolevel models, whose output parameters are quantities that are by no means related. The macrolevel models are interrelated using control models. Control models belong to the metalevel and allow for assigning settings and response thresholds to algorithms used in automation systems. Such a model (megalevel model) allows, ultimately, investigating the dynamics of the entire system as a whole and managing it. © 2023 by the authors.","electric power system; main distribution board; mathematical model; service life; ship; SimInTech 2020; simulation; simulator","Electric power distribution; Electric ship equipment; Ship propulsion; Complex energy systems; Control model; Distribution boards; Energy systems; Main distribution board; Meta levels; Methodological approach; Operating modes; Simintech 2020; Simulation; Automation","","","","","","","Sokolov B.V., Yusupov R.M., Multiple-model description and structure dynamics analysis of space-facilities control systems, SPIIRAS Proc, 4, pp. 7-52, (2010); Gaber M., Elbanna S., El-Dabah M., Hamad M., Intelligent Energy Management System for an all-electric ship based on adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system, Energy Rep, 7, pp. 7989-7998, (2021); Rao X., Sheng C., Guo Z., Yuan C., A review of online condition monitoring and maintenance strategy for cylinder liner-piston rings of diesel engines, Mech.

Although S-A, AB, and RT have been known for a long time, very little is known regarding their potential effects on test-taking anxiety (TTA) and learner enjoyment (LE). Therefore, this study aimed to present a framework depicting the dynamic interaction of AB, RT, LE, S-A, and TTA. Specifically, 394 EFL students from Turkey were given the Academic Buoyancy Scale (ABS), the Reflective Thinking Questionnaire (RTQ), the Test-Taking Anxiety Scale (TTAS), the Core of Self-Assessment Questionnaire (CSAQ), and the Foreign Language Enjoyment Scale (FLES). Higher levels of S-A, AB, RT, and LE were associated with more S-A and less TTA among EFL students, as shown by confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and structural equation modeling (SEM). The findings of this research have important implications for the development of S-A, AB, and RT practices and the introduction of learning-oriented evaluation in educational settings. © 2023, The Author(s).","Academic Buoyancy;

As an official of the Ministry of State Property, in the 1880s, Sluchevsky accompanied the commander of the St. Petersburg Military District, Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich, on his inspection trips to the European north of Russia, its western and Baltic provinces. Sluchevsky's duties included the compilation of reports on the Grand Duke's journey, recording in them of almost every step of the high-ranking traveler and their further publication in periodicals. Despite the official nature of the publications, the materials prepared by Sluchevsky were artistic and documentary essays reflecting the life, customs and traditions of the local population, the development of industry and crafts, climatic and geographical features, history, hydrography and geology of the northwest of Russia. The article analyzes the thematic, genre and structural features of Sluchevsky's essays. The features of his texts are: dynamic storytelling, entertaining presentation, emotionality, a pronounced “presence effect”, a problematic approach to what was seen. Sluchevsky raised the issue of an inefficient use of the vast natural resources of the Russian northwest, pointed to the lack of support for national industry and local crafts from the state, paid considerable attention to the national question in the Baltic provinces, cited facts of discrimination of the local Orthodox Russian-speaking population by the German administration of the region. Sluchevsky's views on the problems of the Russian northwest were close to those of the influential conservative journalist Mikhail Katkov, the publisher-editor of Moscovskie Vedomosti, which contributed to Sluchevsky's publishing his essays in the newspaper. In conclusion, the article emphasizes that these essays are still of undoubted interest from a geographical, ethnographic and cultural point of view, and can serve as a valuable source of information for researchers of the history of the northwestern region. © 2023 Tomsk State University - Faculty of Philology.

Welding conditions were achieved via design of experiment (DOE), and the Box-Behnken design (BBD) method was selected. Welding time, welding current and electrode pressure were recorded as input parameters, while maximum displacement, peak load and failure energy of the welded samples accomplished from tensile shear tests were outputs. The influence of the welding current is superior to the influence of the welding time on the increase of the weld strength as stated by the analysis of variations (ANOVA). Relatively high welding heat input conditions enhance the mechanical attributes of the welds by increasing the nugget size. The largest mechanical properties obtained under the optimum welding conditions are welding time of 14 cycles, welding current of 10.8 kA and electrode force of 0.4 MPa. By verifying the regression models of the optimal welding conditions, the experimental results of the welded specimens with the maximum mechanical properties are about maximum displacement of 2.69 mm, peak load of 11.10 kN and failure energy of 23.90 J. The results show that the proposed spot weld strength models have an estimated accuracy of 5.32%. Due to the complete growth of austenite grains, the martensite in the coarse grain heat-affected zone (CGHAZ) is much larger than that of other zones, while in the HAZ at the side of BH steel, other phases besides martensite are also spotted, such as bainite, Widmanstätten ferrite and grain boundary ferrite. This is because BH steel has a lower carbon content. All welded specimens display hardening in the fine grain heat-affected zone (FGHAZ). © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","ANOVA; BH 220 steel; HSLA 420 steel; Microstructure; Shear-tensile strength; Spot welding","Analysis of variance (ANOVA); Design of experiments; Ferrite; Grain boundaries; Hardening; Heat affected zone; High strength alloys; High strength steel; Martensite; Regression analysis; Shear flow; Spot welding; Analysis of variations; Bake hardening; Bake-hardening 220 steel; High-strength; High-strength low-alloyed 420 steel; Mechanical attributes; Shear-tensile strength; Welding conditions; Welding current; Welding time; Tensile strength","","","","","Russian Science Foundation, RSF, (22–29-20095)","The authors wish to thank the Russian Science Foundation (22–29-20095) for funding.

Pooling medical data into a centralized storage system to train a robust ML model, on the other hand, poses privacy, ownership, and regulatory challenges. Federated learning (FL) overcomes the prior problems with a centralized aggregator server and a shared global model. However, there are two technical challenges: 1) FL members need to be motivated to contribute their time and effort and 2) the centralized FL server may not accurately aggregate the global model. Therefore, combining the blockchain and FL can overcome these issues and provide high-level security and privacy for smart healthcare in a decentralized fashion. This study integrates two emerging technologies, blockchain and FL, for healthcare. We describe how blockchain-based FL plays a fundamental role in improving competent healthcare, where edge nodes manage the blockchain to avoid a single point of failure, while IoMT devices employ FL to use dispersed clinical data fully. We discuss the benefits and limitations of combining both technologies based on a content analysis approach. We emphasize three main research streams based on a systematic analysis of blockchain-empowered: 1) IoMT; 2) electronic health records (EHRs) and electronic medical records (EMRs) management; and 3) digital healthcare systems (internal consortium/secure alerting). In addition, we present a novel conceptual framework of blockchain-enabled FL for the digital healthcare environment. Finally, we highlight the challenges and future directions of combining blockchain and FL for healthcare applications.  © 2014 IEEE.","Blockchain; COVID-19; electronic health records (EHRs); electronic medical records (EMRs); federated learning (FL); healthcare; Internet of Medical Things (IoMT)","Blockchain; Data privacy; Digital storage; Health care; Learning systems; Medical computing; Block-chain; Electronic health; Electronic health record; Electronic medical record; Federated learning; Health records; Healthcare; Internet of medical thing; Internet-of-medical- thing; Medical record; Medical services; Privacy; COVID-19","","","","","","","Alpaydin E., Introduction to Machine Learning, (2020); Sharma V., You I., Andersson K., Palmieri F., Rehmani M.H., Lim J., Security, privacy and trust for smart mobile, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 167123-167163, (2020); Boland M.R., Et al., Uncovering exposures responsible for birth season—Disease effects: A global study, J.

Modern-day time-domain photometric surveys collect a lot of observations of various astronomical objects and the coming era of large-scale surveys will provide even more information on their properties. Spectroscopic follow-ups are especially crucial for transients such as supernovae and most of these objects have not been subject to such studies. Aims. Flux time series are actively used as an affordable alternative for photometric classification and characterization, for instance, peak identifications and luminosity decline estimations. However, the collected time series are multidimensional and irregularly sampled, while also containing outliers and without any well-defined systematic uncertainties. This paper presents a search for the best-performing methods to approximate the observed light curves over time and wavelength for the purpose of generating time series with regular time steps in each passband. Methods. We examined several light curve approximation methods based on neural networks such as multilayer perceptrons, Bayesian neural networks, and normalizing flows to approximate observations of a single light curve. Test datasets include simulated PLAsTiCC and real Zwicky Transient Facility Bright Transient Survey light curves of transients. Results. The tests demonstrate that even just a few observations are enough to fit the networks and improve the quality of approximation, compared to state-of-the-art models. The methods described in this work have a low computational complexity and are significantly faster than Gaussian processes. Additionally, we analyzed the performance of the approximation techniques from the perspective of further peak identification and transients classification. The study results have been released in an open and user-friendly Fulu Python library available on GitHub for the scientific community.  © 2023 The Authors 2023.","Methods: data analysis; Methods: statistical; Supernovae: general","Bayesian networks; Multilayer neural networks; Photometry; Supernovae; Curve approximation; Light curves; Methods.

Improvement of the start-up system of the main diesel locomotive when using a supercapacitor allows multiple restarts of diesel locomotives, meaning that the operation of the diesel locomotive can be stopped several times without wasting fuel in idle operations. In this study, we simulated the electric starting circuit of a diesel locomotive with a block of supercapacitors using the Matlab Simulink program. The simulation results show that using only a supercapacitor in the start-up system is impossible. Even though the supercapacitor produces the required current and voltage, its operating time is extremely insufficient. Using a storage battery along with a supercapacitor in the diesel locomotive start-up system is most effective. This reduces the peak current load on the standard battery. The article suggests an effective principle for starting a mainline diesel locomotive and provides an effective circuit solution involving a supercapacitor. Based on the booster stabilizer scheme, a new scheme was modeled to study the successful launch of a diesel locomotive that has various start-up systems. Applying a supercapacitor in the start-up system of a main diesel locomotive is proposed and the results of its use are presented. In addition, this study defines the basic requirements for using a system based on a battery in conjunction with a supercapacitor. Characteristics such as the temperature range of the system are shown. © 2023 by the authors.","booster converter circuit; diesel locomotive; mainline diesel locomotive start-up; simulation; storage battery; supercapacitor","Diesel engines; Electric loads; Electric power supplies to apparatus; MATLAB; Secondary batteries; Timing circuits; Booster converter circuit; Converter circuits; Currents and voltages; Mainline diesel locomotive start-up; Operating time; Peak currents; Simulation; Simulink program; Storage battery; Urgent problems; Supercapacitor","","","","","","","Blinov P., Blinov A., The Role of Diesel Locomotives Operating Modes in Simulating the Operation of Fuel and Control Equipment of Diesel Locomotives, Networked Control Systems for Connected and Automated Vehicles, (2023); da Silva Moraes C.G., Brockveld S.L., Heldwein M.L., Franca A.S., Vaccari A.S., Waltrich G., Power Conversion Technologies for a Hybrid Energy Storage System in Diesel-Electric Locomotives, IEEE Trans.

Crystals with the composition of (ZrO2)0.99−x(Sc2O3)x(R2O3)0.01 (where x = 0.08–0.1; R-Yb, Y, Tb, Gd) were obtained by the method of directed melt crystallization in a cold crucible. The crystals were annealed in air at a temperature of 1000 °C for 400 h. The phase analysis of the crystals before and after annealing was studied by X-ray diffractometry and Raman spectroscopy. The study of the ionic conductivity of the crystals was carried out by the method of impedance spectroscopy in the temperature range 400–900 °C. It has been shown that when various rare earth cations (Yb, Y, Tb, and Gd) are used, the maximum conductivity is observed for the compositions (ZrO2)0.91(Sc2O3)0.08(Yb2O3)0.01, (ZrO2)0.89(Sc2O3)0.1(Y2O3)0.01, (ZrO2)0.90(Sc2O3)0.09(Tb2O3)0.01, and (ZrO2)0.89(Sc2O3)0.1(Gd2O3)0.01. At the same time, these crystals have a highly symmetrical pseudocubic structure, which is retained even after crystal annealing. At comparable concentrations of Sc2O3, the conductivity of crystals decreases with an increase in the ionic radius of the rare earth cation. The high-temperature degradation of the conductivity is also discussed depending on the type of rare earth oxide and the concentration of scandium oxide. © 2023 by the authors.","luminescence spectra; single crystal; SOFC; structure; zirconia","Annealing; Crystal structure; Luminescence; Phase composition; Positive ions; Rare earths; Scandium compounds; Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC); X ray diffraction analysis; Zirconia; Crystals structures; Electrolytics; High-temperature annealing; High-temperature exposure; Luminescence spectrum; Oxygen-ion conductivity; Rare earth cations; Structural characteristics; Transport characteristics; ZrO 2; Single crystals","","","","","Moscow Polytechnic University; Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation, Minobrnauka, (GK 075-15-2021-696)","Funding text 1: The structure was investigated using the equipment of the Centre for Collective Use of Scientific Equipment, “Material Science and Metallurgy”, purchased with the financial support of the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation (GK 075-15-2021-696). ; Funding text 2: This work was financially supported by the Moscow Polytechnic University within the framework of the grant named after Pyotr Kapitsa.","Liu F., Duan C., Direct-Hydrocarbon Proton-Conducting Solid Oxide Fuel Cells, Sustainability, 13, (2021); Golkhatmi S.Z., Asghar M.I., Lund P.D., A review on solid oxide fuel cell durability: Latest progress, mechanisms, and study tools, Renew.

The individual effect of the welding variables (welding speed, welding current, and wire feed speed) on the geometries of the weld bead and its tensile properties was explored. The characteristics of the microstructure and macrostructure with various welding technological parameters were also investigated. It is indicated that all the selected welding process parameters significantly affect the welding microstructural and macrostructural features of the welded joints as well as their tensile properties. The results imply that no major defects were observed based on the macrostructure examination. The fusion zone (FZ) changes ferrite and pearlite morphology, relying upon the cooling speed and duration time. The FZ exhibits acicular ferrite, Widmanstatten ferrite, and grain boundary ferrite, resulting in its inferior hardness to that of the coarse grain heat-affected zone (CGHAZ) and weld interface (WI). The adjustment of the welding process parameters bringing about the reduction of the welding heat input contributes to the production of acicular ferrite. The hardness of the weld metal steadily decreases from the heat-affected zone (HAZ) to the base metal (BM). The average tensile strength of the weld metal is 596 MPa, which is comparable to that of the BM. The fracture location is in BM, and the fracture behavior retains ductility. After that, models computing the correlations between welding parameters and welding quality indexes (failure energy of the welded joints, depth of the penetration and bottom reinforcement, and standard derivation of the failure energy) were established and analyzed. The optimal welding parameters were figured out using the desirability approach. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Gas metal arc welding; Microstructure; Operating parameters; Tensile properties; Weld bead profile","Alloy steel; Ferrite; Fracture; Fracture mechanics; Gas metal arc welding; Gas welding; Grain boundaries; Hardness; Heat affected zone; High strength alloys; High strength steel; Morphology; Tensile strength; Acicular ferrite; Base metals; Fusion zones; Gas metal arcs; Gas metal-arc welding; Macrostructures; Operating parameters; Weld metal; Weld-bead profile; Welding process parameters; Microstructure","","","","","Russian Science Foundation, RSF, (22–29-20095)","The authors express thanks to the Russian Science Foundation (22–29-20095) for the financial support.

The program allows us to calculate drawing stress, drawing force, tensile strength and yield strength of the alloy after wire drawing, safety factor, and drawing power. The developed mathematical model differs in that it allows us to evaluate the uniformity of deformation over the wire section, depending on the technological parameters of the deformation zone, namely, the semi-angular die, the coefficient of friction and the degree of deformation. To select the technological parameters of the deformation zone, which ensure uniform deformation over the wire cross-section, a nomogram was compiled. The equations of hardening during nickel NP2 wire drawing are obtained. The calculation of energy-power parameters of drawing nickel NP2 (Ni 99.6) wire ∅1.8 mm from ∅4.94 mm wire rod is given. Experimental studies have been carried out to determine the energy-power parameters of nickel wire drawing on a laboratory drawing machine with an installed ring strain gauge to determine the drawing force. A change in the friction coefficient by 0.02 when drawing nickel wire leads to an increase in stress and drawing force by 20%. To improve the accuracy of the developed mathematical model, it is shown that in the future, it would be necessary to conduct experimental studies on a laboratory drawing machine to determine the effect on the energy-power parameters of the drawing process of the values of technological parameters entered into the program as constant real values, such as the friction coefficient, die half-angle, drawing speed, and back tension. © 2023 by the authors.","cold work; drawing force; drawing machine; elongation; nickel; tensile strength; wire; yield strength","","","","","","","","Sheu J.-J., Ho C.-J., Yu C.-H., Kao C.-Y., High-Order Groove-Shape Curve Roll Design for Aluminum Alloy 7075 Wire Rolling, Metals, 12, (2022); Radionov A.A., Petukhova O.I., Erdakov I.N., Karandaev A.S., Loginov B.M., Khramshin V.R., Developing an Automated System to Control the Rolled Product Section for a Wire Rod Mill with Multi-Roll Passes, J.

Methods: Using the methods of correlation analysis and multiple linear regression, a model has been built that shows that there is a close relationship between the key rate and inflation, the volume of currency in circulation, and inflation expectations of the population. Result: The results of the study are consistent with the findings presented in previous works, indicating that inflation is the main factor in making decisions about raising and/or lowering the key rate. Conclusion: The findings of the study suggest that a more thorough analysis of additional factors is necessary, which will allow for the development of a qualitative forecast of economic growth and outline ways to stabilize prices. As a result of the analysis, an equation is obtained that can be used to predict the level of the key rate when certain macroeconomic indicators change. © 2023, Centro Universitario Curitiba - UNICURITIBA.

Based on the results obtained by neutron diffraction, conclusions were drawn about clearly distinguishable stages of phase formation during heating and cooling of metastable high-gallium alloys. Upon heating, the phase composition of studied alloys was found to change in a similar way, namely: BCC + Fe13Ga9 (absent in Fe–31.1 at% Ga) → BCC+ Fe13Ga9 + L12 → BCC + L12 + α-Fe6Ga5 → B2 + α-Fe6Ga5 → B2. Upon cooling, the following sequence of phase states was realized in Fe–32.9Ga and Fe–34.4 at% Ga alloys: B2 → B2 + α-Fe6Ga5 → D03 + L12 + α-Fe6Ga5. Fe–31.1 at% Ga alloy was found to be characterized by the sequence: B2 → B2 + L12 → D03 + L12 + Fe13Ga9. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Fe–Ga alloys; Neutron diffraction; Phase transformation","Binary alloys; Cooling; Gallium alloys; Iron alloys; Neutrons; Phase composition; As-cast; Comparatives studies; Continuous heating; Fe-Ga alloy; Heating up; In-phase; In-situ neutron diffraction; Phase formations; Phases transformation; Subsequent cooling; Neutron diffraction","","","","","Joint Institute for Nuclear Research, JINR; Russian Science Foundation, RSF, (22–42-04404)","Funding text 1: The neutron diffraction data were obtained using the IBR-2 (JINR) neutron source.

A possible competitive advantage for such enterprises is reducing the finished products cost. This may be achieved by reducing the share of energy in this cost, including by rationalizing the use of energy resources. This study develops a system for the automated analysis and calculation of feasible boiler unit loads, defined according to the criterion of the minimum cost of live steam in a separate steam plant pipeline. The calculations consider the balance limit on the steam, the boiler unit’s wear and tear, performance specifications, and economic indicators of fuel consumption in the calculation. The software also defines the optimal fuel mix composition when forecasting the operating modes of the power plant boiler units in real-time mode. The calculation algorithm is based on the dynamic programming technique combined with the sequential equivalenting method, which ensures the convergence of calculations. When a steam plant model is developed, much attention is paid to the thermal scheme and technical and economic specifications of boiler units. In the system, the boiler models are set as a table containing the ratio between the boiler unit’s steam capacity and energy consumption while considering the cost of a ton of live steam with the specified parameters. The key economic effect of implementing the system is determined by reducing the fuel cost due to its rational redistribution between the power plant boiler units. Implementing the system allows the reduction of energy costs by 1.4%. © 2023 by the authors.","dynamic programming technique; energy carrier; energy saving; secondary energy resources; technical and economic model","Boilers; Competition; Cost benefit analysis; Cost reduction; Dynamic programming; Energy utilization; Specifications; Steam; Boiler units; Dynamic programming techniques; Energy; Energy  savings; Energy carriers; Energy-savings; Operating modes; Secondary energy resource; Steam plant; Technical and economic model; Energy conservation","","","","","","","Batukhtin A.G., Makkaveev V.V., Application of Optimization Models for the Heat Supply System Operation, the Thermal Energy Cost, and Increasing the Available CHPP Capacity, Ind.

The results of the study made it possible to determine the yield strength (deformation resistance), ultimate strength and relative elongation of strips of the BrOF6.5–0.15 bronze alloy after rolling with a percent reduction ε = 6–27%. The strips 3 mm thick, 30 mm wide, and approximately 200 mm long were used for test rolling. Based on the data obtained, hardening curves were constructed, which made it possible to establish quantitative patterns of changes in the metal deformation resistance (yield strength) σT, ultimate strength σB and relative elongation δ on the deformation degree of the BrOF6.5–0.15 bronze alloy of a specific chemical composition. Regression equations for calculating and predicting changes in the main indicators of the mechanical properties of strips of the BrOF6.5–0.15 alloy during cold rolling with various reductions have been obtained. The adequacy of the equations obtained, confirmed by high correlation coefficients (R 2 > 0.9), allows recommending them for calculating the force indicators of rolling and the use in computer-aided design systems (CAD) of rational deformation modes of strips of BrOF6.5–0.15 bronze. © 2023, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","150235 mill; BrOF6.5–0.15 bronze; cold rolling; deformation characteristics; deformation degree; hardening curves; mechanical properties; regression equations","Bronze; Cold rolling; Computer aided design; Hardening; Tensile testing; Tin; Yield stress; 150235 mill; Brof6.5–0.15 bronze; Chemical compositions; Deformation Characteristics; Deformation degrees; Deformation resistance; Hardening curves; Regression equation; Relative elongations; Ultimate strength; Phosphorus","","","","","","","Osintsev O.E., Fedorov V.N., Copper and Copper Alloys.

In the last several years, special attention has been paid to the anelastic properties of these alloys. In this review, we collected and analyzed the frequency-, amplitude-, and temperature-dependent anelasticity in Fe–Ga and Fe–Ga-based alloys in the Hertz range of forced and free-decay vibrations. Special attention is paid to anelasticity caused by phase transitions: for this purpose, in situ neutron diffraction tests with the same heating or cooling rates were carried out in parallel with temperature dependencies measurements to control ctructure and phase transitions. The main part of this review is devoted to anelastic effects in binary Fe–Ga alloys, but we also consider ternary alloys of the systems Fe–Ga–Al and Fe–Ga–RE (RE—Rare Earth elements) to discuss similarities and differences between anelastic properties in Fe–Ga and Fe–Al alloys and effect of RE elements. We report and discuss several thermally activated effects, including Zener- and Snoek-type relaxation, several transient anelastic phenomena caused by phase transitions (D03 ↔ A2, D03 → L12, L12 ↔ D019, D019 ↔ B2, Fe13Ga9 → L12+Fe6Ga5 phases), and their influence on the above-mentioned thermally activated effects. We also report amplitude-dependent damping caused by dislocations and magnetic domain walls and try to understand the paradox between the Smith–Birchak model predicting higher damping capacity for materials with higher saturation magnetostriction and existing experimental results. The main attention in this review is paid to alloys with 17–20 and 25–30%Ga as the alloys with the best functional (magnetostriction) properties. Nevertheless, we provide information on a broader range of alloys from 6 to 45%Ga. Due to the limited space, we do not discuss other mechanical and physical properties in depth but focus on anelasticity. A short introduction to the theory of anelasticity precedes the main part of this review of anelastic effects in Fe–Ga and related alloys and unsolved issues are collected in summary. © 2023 by the author.","anelasticity; damping capacity; Fe–Ga based alloys; first- and second-order phase transitions; in situ neutron diffraction; internal friction; magnetostriction; thermally activated; transient and hysteretic effects","Aluminum alloys; Binary alloys; Copper alloys; Damping; Domain walls; Gallium alloys; Iron alloys; Magnetic domains; Neutron diffraction; Rare earths; Ternary alloys; Vibration analysis; Anelasticity; Damping capacity; Fe-Ga alloy; Fe–ga based alloy; First-order phase transitions; Hysteretic effects; In-situ neutron diffraction; Second-order phase transition; Thermally activated; Transient effect; Magnetostriction","","","","","","","Clark A.E., Hathaway K.B., Wun-Fogle M., Restorff J.B., Lograsso T.A., Keppens V.M., Petculescu G., Taylor R.A., Extraordinary Magnetoelasticity and Lattice Softening in Bcc Fe-Ga Alloys, J.

Ultrathin nonwoven fabrics are produced for many applications: biomedical, nanosensors, tissue engineering and filtration systems. In this work, nonwoven polylactide, polylactide/natural rubber, poly-3-hydroxybutyrate, and poly-3-hydroxybutyrate/nitrile butadiene rubber fabrics were prepared by electrospinning methods. The obtained fabric samples were used as substrates for the growth of winter wheat seeds “Yubileinaya 100” (Triticum aestivum L.). The stimulating effect of polymer substrates on seed germination and plant growth was shown. The structure and properties of nonwoven agromaterials were controlled by differential scanning calorimetry, IR-spectroscopy, and optical microscopy. The mechanical properties of the obtained fabrics before and after their utilization as substrates were studied. After the wheat growing experiment, the degree of crystallinity of PHB and PHB/NBR samples decreased by 12% and they completely lost their mechanical properties. It is shown that the main factors providing the efficiency of seed growth technology on polymer substrates are the chemical nature and structure of the biodegradable matrix. © 2023 by the authors.","germination; nonwoven fabrics; poly-3-hydroxybutyrate; polylactide; polymer composites; polymer substrate; wheat seeds","Biodegradable polymers; Crystallinity; Cultivation; Differential scanning calorimetry; Morphology; Nonwoven fabrics; Polyesters; Rubber; Substrates; Tissue engineering; Agro-materials; Non-woven; Poly lactide; Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate); Poly--3-hydroxybutyrate; Poly-3-hydroxybutyrate; Polymer composite; Polymer polylactide; Polymer substrate; Wheat seeds; Germination","","","","","Moscow Polytechnic University; Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation, (075-00268-20-02); state program of basic research “For the long-term development and ensuring the competitiveness of society, (0718-2020-0036)","The work was carried out using the scientific equipment of the Center of Shared Usage “New Materials and Technologies” of the Emanuel Institute of Biochemical Physics RAS and the Joint Research Center of the Plekhanov Russian University of Economics.

Method: the pedagogical experiment was conducted during the academic year. It was attended by students aged 9-10 years (40 people). Coordination abilities were determined by the “Shuttle Run” test, and the distribution of students’ attention by the “Different counting” method. Statistical processing of the results was carried out according to the Bio-Stat program and the T-student was calculated. Results: after the experiment, the indicators in the control group improved by 2.9% (p>0.05) shuttle running, and the distribution of attention from 36.1±2.4 to 32.9±3.4 (p>0.05). In the experimental group, shuttle running significantly improved by 14.1% (p<0.05), and the distribution of attention improved from 9.9±0.5 to 8.5±0.4 (p<0.05). Such data indicate the effective effect of Classical exercises on the indicators of the distribution of students’ attention. Conclusion: if students of 9-10 years of age in physical education classes will perform the Classics exercise, then the indicators of coordination abilities and the distribution of children’s attention will significantly improve. © 2023, Ibn Sina Trust.

The potentials of NOMA are to increase the number of users, the system’s capacity, massive connectivity, and enhance the spectrum and energy efficiency in future communication scenarios. However, the practical deployment of NOMA is hindered by the inflexibility caused by the offline design paradigm and non-unified signal processing approaches of different NOMA schemes. The recent innovations and breakthroughs in deep learning (DL) methods have paved the way to adequately address these challenges. The DL-based NOMA can break these fundamental limits of conventional NOMA in several aspects, including throughput, bit-error-rate (BER), low latency, task scheduling, resource allocation, user pairing and other better performance characteristics. This article aims to provide firsthand knowledge of the prominence of NOMA and DL and surveys several DL-enabled NOMA systems. This study emphasizes Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC), Channel State Information (CSI), impulse noise (IN), channel estimation, power allocation, resource allocation, user fairness and transceiver design, and a few other parameters as key performance indicators of NOMA systems. In addition, we outline the integration of DL-based NOMA with several emerging technologies such as intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS), mobile edge computing (MEC), simultaneous wireless and information power transfer (SWIPT), Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM), and multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO). This study also highlights diverse, significant technical hindrances in DL-based NOMA systems. Finally, we identify some future research directions to shed light on paramount developments needed in existing systems as a probable to invigorate further contributions for DL-based NOMA system. © 2023 by the authors.","Channel State Information (CSI); deep learning; massive connectivity; NOMA; resource allocation; spectral efficiency; Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC)","5G mobile communication systems; Benchmarking; Bit error rate; Channel estimation; Energy efficiency; Energy transfer; Impulse noise; Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing; Radio transceivers; Resource allocation; Spectrum efficiency; Channel state information; Channel-state information; Deep learning; Massive connectivity; Multiple access; Non-orthogonal; Non-orthogonal multiple access; Resources allocation; Spectral efficiencies; Successive interference cancelation; Successive interference cancellations; deep learning; fairness; key performance indicator; noise; resource allocation; review; Channel state information","","","","","Universidad Indoamérica, (INV-0014-03-013)","The APC was funded by Universidad Indoamérica (Ecuador), funding code INV-0014-03-013.","Telecommunication Management; Self-Organizing Networks (SON): Concepts and Requirements; 3GPP TS 32.500 V8.0.0; December 2008; Aliu O.G., Imran A., Imran M.A., Evans B., A survey of self organisation in future cellular networks, IEEE Commun.

A high building density, a large number of vehicles, and industrial enterprises negatively affect both the air quality in the city itself and the climate in general, releasing a significant amount of carbon dioxide. In this regard, there is a need not only to revise the structure of urban developments and strategies for their greening, but also to propose new technologies that radically change the ecological situation. In this paper, solutions using phototrophic microorganisms are considered as such a technology. It is shown that photobioreactors for their cultivation can be successfully integrated into urban systems, while in addition to air purification, the problem of surface wastewater treatment for their further use can also be solved. A wide range of products obtained from the biomass of phototrophic microorganisms significantly increases the economic attractiveness of this approach. Modern technologies in the field of the Internet of Things make it possible to successfully integrate photobioreactors into the urban digital environment. © 2023, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","photobioreactor; phototrophic microorganisms; urban digital system","Agglomeration; Air cleaners; Air quality; Microorganisms; Photobioreactors; Surface treatment; Urban growth; Wastewater treatment; Building densities; Carbon neutralities; Digital system; High building; Number of vehicles; Photobiore-actor; Phototrophic microorganisms; Technology-based; Urban agglomerations; Urban digital system; Carbon dioxide","","","","","","","Shifting Demographics, (2022); Barnett J., City Design: Modernist, Traditional, Green and Systems Perspectives, (2016); Juhola S., Urban Forestry Urban Green, 34, (2018); Brito V.T.F., Ferreira F.A.F., Perez-Gladish B., J.

There is a downward trend in the ore mining rate, which confirms the expediency of processing substandard ores and disposing accumulated waste. A strategy for restoring the lost potential including the use of metal-leaching technologies is formulated. The advantages of such technologies are characterized. It is pointed out that most of the ore processing waste can be used in production. The results of experiments on brining non-extracted metals into solution are presented. The advantages of leaching in disintegrator mills are shown by comparison with the reference case. Changing the quality of recycled mill tailings makes it possible to implement the principles of resource saving for gaining economic benefits. It is concluded that the recommended technology shows a way of technological diversification of production, tailings can be a cheap and affordable raw material for related industries, and the mechanochemical activation of the leaching process in a disintegrator ensures the recovery of metals from the mill tailings of Sadon polymetallic ores. Quantitative strength characteristics of the hardening mixture as a result of activation by alternative methods are obtained. It is established that the strength of concretes based on activated mill tailings increases. © 2023, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","activation; conditions; disintegrator; enrichment; leaching; metals; processing; raw materials; resources; waste","Chemical activation; Metal recovery; Mining; Ores; Condition; Disintegrator; Enrichment; Metal leaching; Mining rates; New sources; Non-waste; Ore mining; Processing plants; Resource; Leaching","","","","","","","Golik V.I., Dmitrak Y.V., Gabaraev O.Z., Kozhiev K.K., Minimization of the influence of mining on the environment, Ekolog.

Currently, the Programmed Pulse Pattern PWM (PPWM) technique is used extensively that allows pre-eliminating the selected harmonics from the converter’s voltage and current spectrum or reducing them to meet the voltage quality standard requirements. A review of scientific publications has shown the insufficiency of available studies on defining and estimating the impact of powerful converters with PPWM. The problem of defining the amplitudes of higher harmonics generated by a converter with PPWM, which are the main cause of electronic equipment failures at the common grid connection point, is particularly relevant. This study considers the behavior of the NPC converter voltage and current spectra at PPWM with the selected harmonic elimination (SHE) for three-level (3L) voltage waveforms. The behavior of up to the 50th non-eliminated harmonics in the NPC converter voltage and current spectra is first shown for a modulation factor changing within 0–1.15 at the pitch of 0.01 for six different SHE PPWM: no. 1–5 and 7; no. 2–5, 7, 11, and 13; no. 3–5, 7, 11, 13, 17, and 19; no. 4–5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 25; no. 5–5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 25; 29, and 31; no. 6–5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 25, 29, 31, 35, and 37. The concept proposed herein allows measuring the current consumed amplitudes of NPC converter with SHE PPWM at the low average error of about 6%. The adequacy of the approach used herein to determine the current harmonic amplitudes has been experimentally verified with laboratory equipment. The results are consistent with engineering accuracy. The research work is promising for further study and estimation of the impact of the NPC converter SHE PPWM for more complex multi-pulse grid connection circuits and resonance phenomena. © 2023 by the authors.","independent voltage inverter; power converter technology; programmed pulse pattern; pulse-width modulation; selected harmonic elimination","Electric inverters; Engineering research; Harmonic analysis; Laboratories; Oscillators (electronic); Power quality; Converter technology; Current spectra; Independent voltage inverte; Power converter technology; Programmed pulse pattern; Pulse pattern; Pulsewidth modulations (PWM); Selected harmonic elimination; Voltage inverter; Voltage spectrum; Pulse width modulation","","","","","Moscow Polytechnic University","This work was financially supported by the Moscow Polytechnic University within the framework of the grant named after Pyotr Kapitsa.","Cheng J., Xu T., Chen D., Chen G., Dynamic and steady state response analysis of selective harmonic elimination in high power inverters, IEEE Access, 9, pp. 75588-75598, (2021); Gabour N.E.H., Habbi F., Bounekhla M., Boudissa E.G., Enhanced Harmonic Elimination Using Genetic Algorithm Optimization in Multilevel Inverters, Proceedings of the 18th International Multi-Conference on Systems, Signals & Devices; Hoevenaars A., Farbis M., McGraw M., Active harmonic mitigation: What the manufacturers don’t tell you, IEEE Ind.

Known problems of deep underground mining do not allow for realizing the potential of man-made gas reservoirs due to the deterioration of the conditions of development of reserves of georesources. The aim of the work was to improve recommendations for the substantiation of drilling parameters for undermined drainage boreholes for increasing methane production from unconventional coal-gas collectors. The authors’ approach innovation lies in the possibility of using the established patterns of better natural stability of undermined boreholes to optimize them as spatial orientation parameters in an existing drilling passport for the improvement of methane extraction productivity. For this purpose, smoothing (LOESS) of the experimental data of two similar types of wells was used; then deterministic interpolation methods in combination with a three-dimensional representation of the response function in “gnuplot” were used. As a result, it was found that the increase in the inclination angle from 40° to 60° leads to a significant transformation of the model of the studied process, accompanied by a decline in the dynamics of methane emission and a decrease in the distance of the productive work zone of this type of well from 13 to 5 m before the roof landing, which then is replaced by a sharp increase in the productive work zone up to 35 m ahead of the longwall face. This allows under specific conditions for recommending increasing the productivity of methane capex from technogenic disturbed coal-gas reservoir replacement of wells with a smaller angle of rise to the transition to a more frequent grid of clusters from wells #4. © 2023 by the authors.","coalbed methane; gas flow modeling; longwall; mining industry decarbonization","Boreholes; Carbonization; Coal; Coal bed methane; Coal deposits; Coal mines; Deterioration; Flow of gases; Infill drilling; Mining; Proven reserves; Condition; Decarbonisation; Drilling parameters; Energy generations; Gas flow model; Gas reservoir; Longwalls; Methane production; Mining industry decarbonization; Work zones; Methane","","","","","Fédération pour la Recherche sur le Cerveau, FRC, (122032300363-3, SSC RAS FGRW-2021-0015)","The study was funded by the state assignment research of FRC SSC RAS FGRW-2021-0015, project N° 122032300363-3 (Brigida V., designing of the author’s approach to modeling nonlinear processes).","Singh R., Khan S., Dsilva J., A framework for assessing critical factor for circular economy practice implementation, J.

Fast and efficient combustion synthesis (CS), spark plasma sintering (SPS), and reactive SPS (RSPS) methods were used to synthesize the HE powders and bulks. The formation of the main B2 phase along with some amounts of secondary BCC and FCC phases are reported, and L12 intermetallic (CS scheme) and BCC based on Cr (CS + SPS and RSPS schemes at 1000 °C) were observed in all samples. The interaction between the components during heating to 1600 °C of the mechanically activated mixtures and CS powders has been studied. It has been shown that the formation of the CoNi0.3Fe0.3Cr0.15Al phase occurs at 1370 °C through the formation of intermediate intermetallic phases (Al9Me2, AlCo, AlNi3) and their solid solutions, which coincidences well with thermodynamic calculations and solubility diagrams. Compression tests at room and elevated temperatures showed that the alloy obtained by the RSPS method has enhanced mechanical properties (σp = 2.79 GPa, σ0.2 = 1.82 GPa, ε = 11.5% at 400 °C) that surpass many known alloys in this system. High mechanical properties at elevated temperatures are provided by the B2 ordered phase due to the presence of impurity atoms and defects in the lattice. © 2023 by the authors.","high-energy ball milling; high-entropy materials; intermetallics; mechanical activation; mechanical properties; microstructure; sintering","Aluminum alloys; Ball milling; Binary alloys; Cobalt alloys; Combustion synthesis; Compression testing; High-entropy alloys; Intermetallics; Iron alloys; Powders; Spark plasma sintering; B2 structures; Direct production; Efficient combustions; Elemental powder mixture; Elevated temperature; High-energy ball milling; High-entropy material; Mechanical activation; Reactive spark plasma sintering; Spark-plasma-sintering; Entropy","","","","","Committee of Science Ministry of Education, Science, Culture and Sports of the Republic of Armenia, (20RF-154, 20TTWS-2F040); Eesti Teadusagentuur, ETAg, (PSG220)","This research was funded by the Committee of Science Ministry of Education, Science, Culture and Sports of the Republic of Armenia (grant numbers 20TTWS-2F040, 20RF-154) and the Estonian Research Council (S.

The results of tensile testing of the samples of such strips are presented, which made it possible to determine the deformation resistance (yield strength), ultimate tensile strength, and percent elongation before and after rolling with a percent reduction of the cross-section area of ε = 10–30%. Based on the obtained data, curves were constructed that allowed us to establish quantitative trends in the variations of metal deformation resistance (yield strength) (σs), ultimate tensile strength (σt), and percent elongation (δ) depending on the degree of deformation of copper M0. It is shown that the ultimate tensile strength (σt) and yield strength σ0.2 (σs) increase with different intensity as the percent reduction increases. The σt parameter demonstrates a slow linear monotonic increase from 221 to 315 MPa as the percent reduction changes from 0 to 30%; while σ0.2 (σs) increases intensively according to the parabolic law from 41 to 308 MPa. The ductility index decreases from 63 to 16% within this deformation range. Regression equations have been obtained for calculating the basic mechanical properties of copper M0 during the process of cold rolling at various reductions. The adequacy of the obtained equations, confirmed by high correlation coefficient values (R 2 > 0.9), makes it possible to recommend them for calculating the power characteristics of the rolling process, as well as for use in the automated design (CAD) systems to determine the rational copper strips (M0) deformation conditions at the industrial sheet rolling mills. © 2023, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","copper M0; deformation resistance; degree of deformation; hardening curves; mechanical properties; regression equation; strip rolling; ultimate tensile strength; yield strength","Cold rolling; Computer aided design; Copper alloys; Hardening; Strip metal; Tensile strength; Tensile testing; % reductions; Chemical compositions; Copper m0; Copper strips; Deformation resistance; Degree of deformations; Hardening curves; Regression equation; Strip-rolling; Ultimate tensile strength; Yield stress","","","","","","","Raikov Y.N., Ashikhmin G.V., Polukhin V.P., Gulyaev A.S., Copper Alloys.

In addition, diesel power plants require regular maintenance, have a relatively short service life during continuous operation and produce a large amount of emissions into the environment. This article discusses various methods of placing solar panels in the space for the autonomous power supply of weather station equipment. The principles of these methods are described and their advantages and disadvantages are outlined. The optimal algorithms of functioning for photomodules are described and their comparison regarding the main, significant parameters is carried out. The choice of the most effective algorithm for use at a weather station is made. The effective positioning of solar panels is also calculated, and positioning conditions are determined depending on the territorial location and various environmental conditions. Simulation of the power supply system of a weather station consisting of solar panels, batteries and inverters is performed. As a result, a practical example of the application of the method of selecting the optimal composition of equipment for a hybrid power system of a weather station territorially located in Siberia with different configurations of equipment is considered. In numerical terms, it was possible to reduce the cost of power equipment operation by more than 60% with a fairly low payback period of 5.5 years and an increased reliability of the power system, which is very important for autonomous power systems of northern weather stations. © 2023 by the authors.","autonomous power supply; electrical equipment; power engineering; small power system; weather station","Electric power supplies to apparatus; Investments; Solar concentrators; Standby power systems; Weather information services; Autonomous power supply; Autonomous power system; Electrical equipment; Power engineering; Power supply; Remote areas; Small power systems; Solar panels; Station equipment; Weather stations; Solar panels","","","","","","","Zahraoui Y., Alhamrouni I., Mekhilef S., Basir Khan M.R., Seyedmahmoudian M., Stojcevski A., Horan B., Energy Management System in Microgrids: A Comprehensive Review, Sustainability, 13, (2021); Tailor R., Bena L., Conka Z., Kolcun M., Design of Management Systems for Smart Grid, Proceedings of the 2021 Selected Issues of Electrical Engineering and Electronics (WZEE); Mohseni S., Brent A.C., Burmester D., Off-Grid Multi-Carrier Microgrid Design Optimisation: The Case of Rakiura-Stewart Island, Aotearoa-New Zealand, Energies, 14, (2021); Min H.S., Wagh S., Kadier A., Gondal I.A., Azim N.A.P.B.A., Mishra M.K., Edition: 7 Chapter: Renewable Energy Technologies, (2018); Yelemessov K., Sabirova L.B., Martyushev N.V., Malozyomov B.V., Bakhmagambetova G.B., Atanova O.V., Modeling and Model Verification of the Stress-Strain State of Reinforced Polymer Concrete, Materials, 16, (2023); Jurasz J., Canales F.A., Kies A., Guezgouz M., Beluco A., A review on the complementarity of renewable energy sources: Concept, metrics, application and future research directions, Sol.

Zabelin (1820-1908) is known as an outstanding historian and archaeologist, but as a teacher of the Russian higher school he is much less known. In this work, the program of the course ""Russian history in connection with archaeology"", stored in the archive of the scientist, is introduced into scientific circulation. Ivan Egorovich gave lectures on historical disciplines to students of the Konstantinovsky Boundary Institute from 1853 to 1865. Turning to the experience of teaching archaeology accumulated by Russian pedagogy opens up a way for modern archaeological education to get out of the state of crisis in which it is located. The identification of I.E. Zabelin's civic position through the prism of his reflections on teaching history and archeology to young people, the clarification of the scientist's contribution to the methodology and didactics of historical disciplines is fundamentally new. The concept of teaching archaeology, which was developed and applied by I.E. Zabelin, has not been considered in detail in the literature. I.E. Zabelin introduces into his course a new study of folk folklore as a source for that time, introduces students to an innovative approach to the study of Slavic settlements, developed by Z. Khodakovsky. The example of the course program shows that I.E. Zabelin was ahead of his time more than once. He grouped ancient artifacts by material and purpose, introduced listeners to the technology of antiquities production. An undoubted contribution to the theory of archaeology is the presentation of archaeology as a historical discipline, which has firmly entered the Russian scientific tradition. I.E. Zabelin was a talented teacher, turned to historical and material sources to create his course, used the principle of clarity in teaching. He saw the task of archeology in studying the life of the people, instilled in students a love of reading scientific literature, working with ancient artifacts, attention to the destinies and ideals of his people. The pupils appreciated and loved their teacher. Awareness of the humanistic orientation of archaeology, reliance in teaching on the whole range of sources, a high civic position are important for the archaeological education of the XXI century.

Most of the techniques used for this purpose are based on theoretical studies. These studies suggest that the observed diffraction patterns are caused by random stacking faults in crystals. In reality, however, the condition of randomness for stacking faults may be violated. The purpose of the study was to develop a technique that can be used to calculate the diffraction effects of the axis of the thin plates of twin, new phases, as well as other variations in defective structures. Materials and methods. This was achieved through modern X-ray diffraction methods using differential equations (transformations and Fourier transforms) and the construction of the Ewald sphere, mathematical analysis, mathematical logic, and mathematical modeling (complex Markov chain). Conclusion. The study made it possible to develop a technique for the calculation of the diffraction effects of the axis of the thin plates of twin, new phases and other variations in defective structures. The technique makes it possible to solve several complex, urgent problems related to the calculation of X-ray diffraction for crystals with face-centered lattices containing different types of stacking faults. At the same time, special attention was paid to the correlations between the relative positions of faults. The calculations showed that the proposed method can help to determine the nature and structure of stacking faults by identifying the partial and vertex dislocations limiting them in twin crystals with a face-centered cubic structure of silicon carbide based on X-ray diffraction analysis. © 2023 by the authors.","crystals with a face-centered lattice; multi-layer stacking fault; solid amorphous bodies; wave amplitude; X-ray diffraction; X-ray structural analysis","","","","","","","","Bae S.-G., Kim S., Jeong H., Lee Y., Jeong Y.-G., Shin D.-G., Effect of carbon and oxygen on the high-temperature properties of silicon carbide–hafnium carbide nanocomposite fiber, J.

Two different scanning strategies were used: the convenient single laser exposure scanning strategy and the newly proposed double scanning strategy aimed at improving the melting process and increasing the density of the synthesized material. Samples with a relative density value higher than 95% were obtained using the new scanning strategy by reducing void volume and cracks. This was achieved by decreasing internal stresses and reducing the tendency to form and propagate cracks. The double scanning strategy of half laser power followed by full power exposure provides higher magnetic properties (both coercive force and remanence). The coercive force increases with energy input decrease, while remanence has inverse dependence. © 2023 by the authors.","3D printing; hard magnetic material; laser powder bed fusion; Nd<sub>2</sub>Fe<sub>14</sub>B; permanent magnet; rare earth intermetallic; scanning strategy; selective laser melting","","","","","","Lomonosov Moscow State University Program of Development; Russian Science Foundation, RSF, (21-79-10239); Lomonosov Moscow State University, MSU","Funding text 1: This research was funded by the Russian Science Foundation (RSF), grant number 21-79-10239.; Funding text 2: The work was supported in part by M.V.

However, its fabrication requires high-temperature treatment at ∼2000 – 2100 °С. In this study, we developed an approach based on low-temperature reactive spark plasma sintering to produce dense SiC-based ceramics with superior mechanical properties. It was found that an SPS temperature of 1600 °C and introduction of 10 – 15 wt% of mechanically activated non-oxide Ti–Si–C additive is required to manufacture ceramics with a theoretical density of higher than 90%. Nonetheless, employing 5 – 15 wt% of the additive mixture and an SPS temperature of 1700 °C, the maximum density of ∼ 98% was achieved. The controlled formation and decomposition of the in-situ Ti3SiC2 MAX phase enables the fabrication of the engineering ceramics with enhanced compressive strength (550 MPa), elastic modulus (485 GPa), and microhardness (32 GPa), which are comparable to the best-reported SiC ceramics. The study has a significant potential for practical application in the production of advanced SiC-based ceramics for various purposes and could be used for further understanding and development of the high-temperature sintering methods. © 2022 The Authors","Ceramics; MAX phase; Mechanical properties; Microstructures; Silicon carbide; Spark plasma sintering","Additives; Compressive strength; Spark plasma sintering; Temperature; Titanium oxides; Additive mixture; Advanced applications; Ceramic; High temperature treatments; Lows-temperatures; MAX-phase; Reactive spark plasma sintering; SiC-based ceramics; Spark-plasma-sintering; Theoretical density; Silicon carbide","","","","","","","Abderrazak H., Hmida E.S.B.H., Silicon carbide: synthesis and properties, Properties and Applications of Silicon Carbide, (2011); Moskovskikh D.O., Mukasyan A.S., Rogachev A.S., Self-propagating high-temperature synthesis of silicon carbide nanopowders, Dokl.

It was found that EIMGM increases the polar component and the complete free surface energy from 26 to 57 mJ/m2 for LDPE and from 37 to 67 mJ/m2 for PET (due to the formation of oxygen-containing groups on the surface of the materials). Although the degree of textural and morphological heterogeneity of the modified LDPE increased more than twice compared to the initial state, it is not still suitable for application as a substrate in extrusion 3D printing. However, for PET, the plasma-chemical modification contributed to a significant increase (~5 times) in filament adhesion to its surface (due to chemical and morphological transformations of the surface layers) which allows for using the FFF technology for additive prototyping on the modified PET-substrates. © 2023 by the authors.","additive manufacturing; adhesion; electro-induced multi-gas treatment; free surface energy; LDPE; PET; variation-rotation pictures","","","","","","Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation, Minobrnauka, (FZRR-2023-0003)","This work was carried out with the financial support of the Ministry of science and higher education of the Russian Federation (State assignment FZRR-2023-0003).","Bressers H.J.L., van Driel W.D., Jansen K.M.B., Ernst L.J., Zhang G.Q., Correlation between chemistry of polymer building blocks and microelectronics reliability, Microelectron.

The influence of the synthesis temperature, the exposure time, and the density of the charge (TiO2 + ZrO2 + Nb2O5 + CaH2) on the mechanism and kinetics of the calcium hydride synthesis of the Ti-18Zr-15Nb β-alloy was studied. Temperature and exposure time were established as crucial parameters with the help of regression analysis. Moreover, the correlation between the homogeneity of the powder obtained and the lattice microstrain of β-Ti is shown. As a result, temperatures above 1200 °C and an exposure time longer than 12 h are required to obtain a Ti-18Zr-15Nb powder with a single β-phase structure and uniformly distributed elements. The analysis of β-phase growth kinetics revealed that the formation of β-Ti occurs due to the solid-state diffusion interaction between Ti, Nb, and Zr under the calcium hydride reduction of TiO2 + ZrO2 + Nb2O5, and the spongy morphology of reduced α-Ti is inherited by the β-phase. Thus, the results obtained provide a promising approach for manufacturing biocompatible porous implants from β-Ti alloys that are believed to be attractive candidates for biomedical applications. Moreover, the current study develops and deepens the theory and practical aspects of the metallothermic synthesis of metallic materials and can be compelling to specialists in powder metallurgy. © 2023 by the authors.","calcium hydride synthesis; reaction mechanism; solid-state diffusion; Ti-Zr-Nb; β-Ti alloy","alloy; calcium derivative; calcium hydride; metal oxide; titanium; titanium dioxide; titanium zirconium niobium alloy; unclassified drug; zirconium oxide; Article; biocompatibility; chemical structure; controlled study; diffusion; porosity; powder; synthesis; temperature","","titanium, 7440-32-6; titanium dioxide, 1317-70-0, 1317-80-2, 13463-67-7, 51745-87-0; zirconium oxide, 1314-23-4, 53801-45-9","","","Committee of the Tula region of Science and Innovation; Russian Science Foundation, RSF, (22-23-20124)","The current study was conducted with the financial support of regional Committee of the Tula region of Science and Innovation within the Russian Science Foundation Project No. 22-23-20124.","Niinomi M., Recent Research and Development in Titanium Alloys for Biomedical Applications and Healthcare Goods, Sci.

It is substantiated that the level of danger of the consequences of mining and processing of ores can be reduced by waste disposal. The purpose of the study is to detail the processes of waste management for minimizing their impact on humans and the environment. An ecosystem management system based on environmental monitoring and waste disposal is proposed. As a resultant element of the research, a mathematical description of the mechanism and parameters of the movement of pollutants is given. The assessment of the concentration of pollutants was carried out on the example of the atmosphere of Vladikavkaz. The possibility of recycling of transfer products is justified, which increases the safety of the environment and employees. A mathematical model is proposed for calculating the parameters of ecosystem interaction with mobile pollutants and a criterion for assessing environmental friendliness, depending on the degree of waste use. An arsenal is recommended concerning the technologies for minimizing the negative consequences of mining. It is shown that the economic efficiency of environmental conservation through waste disposal should be determined by comparing the resulting costs. Directions are proposed for improving the efficiency of field development technologies. The performance of filling complexes with activation of the components depends on the capabilities of the activator. On the example of a specific deposit, the efficiency of waste activation was demonstrated for several years. It is concluded that the mining safety management system is formed based on combining monitoring capabilities and technological processes. At the same time, the environmental and economic performance of a mining enterprise largely depends on the use of mining and processing waste. © 2023, STC Industrial Safety CJSC.","mineral raw materials; model; occupational safety; ore; processing waste; recycling; technologies","","","","","","","","Khayrutdinov A., Paleev I., Artemov S., Replacement of traditional components of the backfill mixture with man-made waste, IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science, 942, (2021); Golik V.I, Dmytrak Yu.V., Komashchenko V.I., Razore-nov Yu.I., Environmental aspects of storing tails of ore dressing in a mountain region, Ekologiya i promyshlennost Rossii = Ecology and Industry of Russia, 22, 6, pp. 35-39, (2018); Valiev N.G., Propp V.D., Vandyshev A.M., The 100th An-niversary of the Department of Mining Engineering of UrSMU.

However, in order to obtain correct simulation results, it is necessary to set the boundary conditions as accurately as possible. At present, design programs usually use friction laws that do not take into account the sliding velocity. As numerous studies show, the sliding velocity of a deformed metal on the tool surface has a significant influence on the formation process under certain conditions of the flow of the deformed material at the tool–workpiece interface. This article presents the results of experiments and calculations associated with the effect of contact friction on the parameters of upsetting with torsion. © 2023, Allerton Press, Inc.","computer simulation; contact friction; formation; sliding velocity; upsetting with torsion","Abstracting; Friction; Metal forming; Contact friction; Deformed metals; Design programs; Formation; Formation process; Friction laws; Optimisations; Sliding velocities; Tool surfaces; Upsetting with torsion; Torsional stress","","","","","","","Zibel' E., Die Formgebung im bildsamen Zustande: Theoretische Grundlagen der technische Formgebungsverfahren, (1932); Levanov A.N., Kolmogorov V.L., Kontaktnoe Trenie V Protsessakh Obrabotki Metallov Davleniem (Contact Friction in Metal Processing Processes), (1976); Behrens A., Schafstall H., 2D and 3D simulation of complex multistage forging processes by use of adaptive friction coefficient, J.

However, the behavior, oxidation mechanisms, and factors defining oxidation resistance of some popular HECs at high temperatures have not been studied in detail yet. In this study, the oxidation behavior of MEC and HECs including (Ta,Ti,Nb,Zr)C, (Ta,Ti,Nb,Zr,Mo)C, (Ta,Ti,Nb,Zr,Hf)C, and (Ta,Ti,Nb,Zr,W)C was investigated under both non-isothermal and isothermal conditions at temperatures up to 1200 °C, and a possible oxidation path was described. It was found that under non-isothermal heating conditions, the oxidation of HECs occurred in three stages, each governed by first-order chemical reactions, and was limited by the formation of ZrO2, Me2Me6O17, and MeMe2O7 oxides, respectively. In the case of isothermal heating, the oxidation of (Ta,Ti,Nb,Zr)C, (Ta,Ti,Nb,Zr,Mo)C, and (Ta,Ti,Nb,Zr,Hf)C follows a logarithmic law and was limited by the formation of a protective Me2Me6O17 layer. In contrast, isothermal oxidation of (Ta,Ti,Nb,Zr,W)C followed a linear law due to the formation of volatile WO3. The results of the study have a high potential for practical application for the production of HEC ceramics for various high-temperature purposes and could be used for further understanding of functional characteristics and development of the new ceramic compositions. © 2023 The Author(s)","High-entropy carbides; Kinetics; Oxidation; Phase composition; Self-propagating high-temperature synthesis","Carbides; High temperature applications; Isotherms; Oxidation resistance; Thermooxidation; Titanium compounds; Tungsten compounds; Zirconia; Advanced applications; High-entropy carbide; Highest temperature; Isothermal conditions; Mechanism and kinetics; Monocarbides; Nonisothermal; Oxidation behaviours; Oxidation mechanisms; Self propagating high temperature synthesis; Entropy","","","","","Russian Science Foundation, RSF, (18-79-10215)","This study was conducted with the financial support of the Russian Science Foundation (Grant No. 18-79-10215).

The aim of the study is to improve the processes of blade processing of small-sized parts made of beryllium bronze and the 29 NK alloy to provide rational conditions for thermal pulse deburring. Surface samples were experimentally obtained after turning in different modes on a CITIZEN CINCOM K16E-VII automatic lathe equipped with an Applitec micromechanics tool. The surface quality and burr characteristics were examined using a JEOL JIB-Z4500 electron microscope and a ContourGT-K optical profilometer. The program Statistica 6 allowed processing of the results. The relationship between the parameters of the turning mode and the thickness of the root of the burrs formed on the machined surface, the limitation of which is one of the conditions for the application of the thermal pulse method, was established. The obtained empirical regression dependencies establish a rational range of cutting mode parameters, and the implementation of the formulated recommendations for setting blade modes ensures deburring by the thermal pulse method in compliance with the requirements of drawing under maximum processing performance. © 2023 by the authors.","deburring; edge processing; processing of alloy 29 NK; processing of beryllium bronze; thermal impulse processing","Beryllium; Turning; Condition; Edge processing; Processing method; Processing of alloy 29 NK; Processing of beryllium bronze; Pulse methods; Technical processing; Thermal impulse; Thermal impulse processing; Thermal pulse; Bronze","","","","","","","Dzhurinsky K., Miniature Coaxial Radio Components for Microwave Microelectronics, Connectors, Coaxial-Microstrip Transitions, Adapters, Microwave Inputs, Low-Frequency Inputs, Isolation Racks, Noise Filters, (2006); Dzhurinsky K.B., Latest advances in rf connectors, Electron.

I.E. Zabelin is known not only for his purely historical works, but also works in the field of archeology. Under his leadership, the richest Scythian burial mounds in southern Russia were excavated. The most famous of them is the Chertomlyk mound, which brought real masterpieces of Scythian and Greek art to the treasury of the Imperial Hermitage. Scientists who analyzed the activities of I.E. Zabelin as an archaeologist, were based, as a rule, on publications belonging to the pen of the scientist. This gave rise to a series of misunderstandings and false accusations against the great Russian historian. The authors of this article used archival materials, manuscripts and field diaries of I.E. Zabelin, which allowed to debunk a number of biases that have become a kind of scientific myths. I.E. Zabelin appears as an attentive, thorough and observant archaeologist who developed his own, innovative methods of excavation and fixation of layers, as evidenced by the plans and sections of the mounds made by him. The historian independently analyzed the materials of the expeditions, studied the works of ancient authors, carried out thorough measurements and compiled detailed descriptions of monuments and artifacts. Since extracts from ancient authors are dotted with remarks of a purely linguistic nature, and the inventories of finds contain multi-page copies of ancient Greek amphoric stamps, tombstones, inscriptions on vessels, the authors of this article question the thesis of I.E. Zabelin's ignorance of the Greek language. Assessment at the modern scientific level of the contribution of I.E. Zabelin. The introduction to the theory of archaeology and the teaching of this discipline is the task of a separate study.

When modeling thermal “loads”, film conductors on silicon with a thickness of up to 3 µm and a width of 10–75 µm were considered. Based on the experimental oscillograms taken from sections of the test structures during the passage of a current pulse and the calculation performed, the maximum temperatures on the silicon surface near the thermal shock source were determined. It has been experimentally revealed that the passage of current pulses with an amplitude of 2 × 1011 A/m2 and a duration of up to 250 µs leads to thermal destruction of interconnects and contributes to the formation of plastic deformation regions in the near-surface layer of silicon. It was revealed that with a decrease in the track width, the nature of the melting of the film conductor does not change. It was also established that a significantly higher specific energy is required to melt narrower tracks. The analysis of the maximum temperature gradients identified the places of the most probable cracking. The formation of cracks in the near-surface layer of a semiconductor at a depth of 2.5 µm after the passage of a single current pulse was experimentally detected. An assessment was made of the magnitude of mechanical stresses arising in the structure during thermal shock. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Degradation; Electric current pulse; Metallization path; Monocrystalline silicon; Thermal shock; Thermomechanical stresses","Aluminum; Ductile fracture; Integrated circuit interconnects; Monocrystalline silicon; Aluminum interconnects; Current pulse; Electric current pulse; Film conductors; Metallisation; Metallization path; Near-surface layers; Pulse current heating; Pulse currents; Thermo-mechanical stress; Thermal shock","","","","","Russian Science Foundation, RSF, (22–29-01373)","The study was supported by the Russian Science Foundation (Grant No. 22–29-01373).

Methods: This was a cross-sectional study conducted in a secondary school in Russia, it was attended by ninth graders aged 15-16 years in the number of 141 schoolchildren. The main method of research was the test “Cross out an extra word”, which determines the level of development of students’ thinking. The test was used before and after the physical education lesson 1 time per month for 5 months. Statistical analysis used: The student’s T-criterion was used in the study. Results: children who did not engage in physical education in the classroom were not able to significantly improve their performance in the test, which indicates a possible adaptation to the test after its first performance before the lesson. Children who were engaged in physical exercises were able to significantly increase the test results. Conclusion: the effectiveness of the influence of a physical education lesson at school on thinking indicators. This study will serve as an additional motivation for children to engage in physical culture, since the impact of physical exercises has a positive impact not only on the development of physical qualities, but also on the development of schoolchildren’s thinking. © 2023, Ibn Sina Trust.

The authors proposed to analyze not only TBC but also EBC from the point of view of the optics of semitransparent scattering and absorbing media in the range of ~0.4–4 μm of external radiant action. This paradigm allows us to continue the study of ceramic fibers embedded in ceramic matrix CMCs (C/C, C/SiC, SiC/SiC) as a traditional class of opaque materials. However, at the same time, mullites, Al2O3/Al2O3 have been reviewed as a class of semitransparent elements for designing CMCs. The relevance of studying the effect of oriented fibers on the formation of thermoradiation and temperature fields in a semitransparent material was noted. Modeling the scattering asymmetry coefficient influence (scattering phase function) on the generation of the subsurface thermal radiation source was carried out. The methodology for calculating the thermoradiative field in a semitransparent medium (with relative absorption, scattering indexes, and scattering asymmetry coefficient) was used under a one-dimensional two-flux model as the first approximation for solving the radiative heat transfer equation. Calculations of temperature profiles in opaque and semitransparent ceramics were presented under heat load typical for the combustion chambers operating regime of diesel and gas turbine engines. © 2023 by the authors.","asymmetry; ceramics; EBC; phase scattering function; semitransparent; subsurface temperature maximum; TBC; zirconia","","","","","","","","Nieto A., Agrawal R., Bravo L., Hofmeister-Mock C., Pepi M., Ghoshal A., Calcia–magnesia–alumina–silicate (CMAS) attack mechanisms and roadmap towards Sandphobic thermal and environmental barrier coatings, Int.

The review of technical solutions for reactive power compensation showed that the limitations on the transmitted reactive power in the system under consideration still have not been studied. The paper provides a mathematical description and proposes synthesis-friendly block diagrams of the mathematical 3L-NPC-AFE-VSI and SMD models. The developed models allow defining the instantaneous values of the total 3L-NPC-AFE power consumed from the grid depending on the SMD load diagram. It is noted that the 3L-NPC-AFE-VSI-SMD system is designed without considering the opportunities for reactive power generation. It was determined that the limit value of reactive power generated by a 3L-NPC-AFE depends on the DC link voltage, the grid current consumption and the modulation index. The possibility of reactive power compensation by the SMD system through a 3L-NPC-AFE was experimentally tested on the main drive of a metal plate hot rolling mill. The analysis of the results obtained showed that during the breakdown, an SMD can generate reactive power equal to 16% of the total rated power using a 3L-NPC-AFE at a rated DC link voltage and without overcurrent. It was shown that generating reactive power is expedient in low-load SMD operation modes or at idle. Research in this area is promising due to the widespread use of high-power SMD based on a 3L-NPC-AFE-VSI and the tightening of requirements for energy saving and efficiency and supply voltage quality. The proposed reactive power control technique can be used as part of an industrial smart grid. © 2023 by the authors.","control systems; power converters; power quality; reactive power compensation; regenerative electric drive","","","","","","Moscow Polytechnic University","This work was financially supported by Moscow Polytechnic University under a grant named after Pyotr Kapitsa.","Abu-Rub H., Bayhan S., Moinoddin S., Malinowski M., Guzinski J., Medium-Voltage Drives: Challenges and existing technology, IEEE Power Electron.

In accordance with the Incheon Declaration adopted at the World Education Forum in May 2015, UNESCO was tasked with guiding and coordinating the implementation of the Education 2030 Agenda. An important factor determining the success of solving the tasks set (ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education and encouraging lifelong learning opportunities for all) is the factor of the dynamics of the educational environment, which is intensively transformed and modernized in the conditions of digitalization of the entire educational space, while having a significant impact on the possibilities of professional self-realization of teachers of educational institutions. The purpose of the study is to determine the structure of the modalities of professional self-realization of a teacher, taking into account their semantic meaning in the conditions of an online communication educational environment. Materials and methods. The study was carried out with the participation of 76 teachers of pedagogical universities in Moscow. The method of psychodiagnostics of the level of partial readiness of the examined persons for professional self-development was used. This method is designed to determine the main components of self-development in relation to specific conditions of professional activity. The survey was conducted remotely using Google Forms, generalization and systematization of the data obtained. The methods of statistical data processing were used: percentage calculations, the criterion of reliability of the differences of the t-Student. The results of the study. Teachers consider unavailability to work in an online environment (45%) and insufficient information and communication technology skills (60%) as perceived barriers to self-realization. To overcome such obstacles, the majority of the surveyed consider it necessary to form motivational (90%) and operational (84%) readiness, that is, the development of practical skills through information and communication technologies and the development of cognitive competence in general (76%). The motivational component of the potential for professional self-development is significantly higher in the older age group, which indicates the greater importance of additional motivation for these individuals when working in an online communication educational environment. In the younger age group, this indicator is also quite high and characterizes the average level of development of professional self-development potential, but the differences between both groups are significant. Conclusion. Self-realization of the potential of a teacher of a pedagogical university in an online communication educational environment depends on his individual motives for self-development. But the age of the teacher, his teaching experience and professional experience are of fundamental importance and quite specific meaning for assessing the possibilities of his self-development in such conditions of the educational environment. © 2023 LLC Ecological Help.

The developed method for screen printing provides the formation of polycrystalline films of a specified area per cycle, provided that there is a possibility for varying their thickness from tens of microns to units, which allows reducing the solar cell’s thickness and facilitating the process of its connection with the substrate. Therefore, the application of the films to a sitall substrate by screen printing contributes to reducing the product weight and facilitating the process of joining sheet materials intended for solar panels, namely attaching the lasing element to the substrate. The purpose of this work is to study the morphological peculiarities of polycrystalline CdS1−xSex films obtained by an optimized screen-printing method and to create a model of their formation process. The structural and morphological peculiarities of the samples were studied using electron microscopy, AFM, XPA, and XFS. As a result of the work, based on the obtained experimental data, a model of the film formation process was developed. The model validity is justified by the conformity of the data of the experiment performed on its basis. © 2023 by the authors.","AFM; flexible substrate; morphology; polycrystalline CdS<sub>1−x</sub>Se<sub>x</sub> films; screen-printing method; structure; thickness variation from tens of microns to units; XPS; XRD","","","","","","","","Agaponova A.V., Ryzhikov I.A., Meshkov A.S., Evgen'ev S.B., Strateichuk D.M., Ostretsov E.F., Survilo L.N., Trofimov Y.V., Shtanov V.I., Investigation of the photoresistance of granular CdS x Se1 − x films obtained by screen printing, J.

The effectiveness of surface modification of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and polypropylene (PP) was confirmed by corresponding changes in the absorption spectra of infrared radiation with the modified samples. The gas-phase fluorination quality of ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) and nitrile butadiene rubber (NBR) surfaces was evidenced by the results of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersion analysis (EDS). As was shown with the direct measurements of water and ethyleneglycol wetting angles, the properties differences of the polymer materials with modified surfaces from the initial one correlated well with the change in free surface energy induced by the chemical and morphological transformations under the fluorine and oxygen-containing gas mixtures treatment. The developed technique for the bio-contamination degree quantifying, based on the computer analysis of the corresponding images, allowed us to establish that gas-phase fluorination of the surface approximately doubles the time during which the biofouling of LDPE, PP and UHMWPE with the mixed colony of Rivularia and Stigonema Minutum algae occurs under natural conditions. No positive effect from fluorination was observed for NBR, which was explained, from our point of view, by the difference in the mechanisms of biostability for the considered polymer materials. © 2023 by the authors.","biostability; elastomers; fluorination; mathematical modeling; microalgae; thermoplastics","","","","","","Moscow Polytechnic University","The reported study was funded by Moscow Polytechnic University (Grant named after V.

We developed the scoring model which was based on the methodologies of international and Russian rating agencies. The modelled ratings of non-financial companies for 2018–2020 were compared with actual ratings assigned by the rating agencies and discrepancies were explained. The sample includes companies from retail, protein and agriculture, steel, oil and gas sectors from Russia, USA, Luxembourg, England, Canada, India, Ukraine and Brazil. The paper proved that addition of business and environmental, social and governance factors improved the quality of scoring models in comparison to those including only financial metrics. There are strong patterns in the resulting ratings of companies for some industries. Retail industry companies are associated with high sales indicators, while steel industry companies have high interest expenses coverage ratios. Oil and gas industry companies mostly show high results in reserves coefficients. The study developed a credit rating forecasting tool that emulates the work of analysts of rating agencies and therefore has a high predictive power.

One of the critical concerns, however, is the spectrum scarcity, due to the unprecedented broadcast penetration rate nowadays. Based on this, visible light communication (VLC) has recently emerged as a viable solution to secure high-speed communications. VLC, a high data rate communication technology, has proven its stature as a promising complementary to its radio frequency (RF) counterpart. VLC is a cost-effective, energy-efficient, and secure technology that exploits the current infrastructure, specifically within indoor and underwater environments. Yet, despite their appealing capabilities, VLC systems face several limitations which constraint their potentials such as LED’s limited bandwidth, dimming, flickering, line-of-sight (LOS) requirement, impact of harsh weather conditions, noise, interference, shadowing, transceiver alignment, signal decoding complexity, and mobility issue. Consequently, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has been considered an effective technique to circumvent these shortcomings. The NOMA scheme has emerged as a revolutionary paradigm to address the shortcomings of VLC systems. The potentials of NOMA are to increase the number of users, system’s capacity, massive connectivity, and enhance the spectrum and energy efficiency in future communication scenarios. Motivated by this, the presented study offers an overview of NOMA-based VLC systems. This article provides a broad scope of existing research activities of NOMA-based VLC systems. This article aims to provide firsthand knowledge of the prominence of NOMA and VLC and surveys several NOMA-enabled VLC systems. We briefly highlight the potential and capabilities of NOMA-based VLC systems. In addition, we outline the integration of such systems with several emerging technologies such as intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS), orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Furthermore, we focus on NOMA-based hybrid RF/VLC networks and discuss the role of machine learning (ML) tools and physical layer security (PLS) in this domain. In addition, this study also highlights diverse and significant technical hindrances prevailing in NOMA-based VLC systems. We highlight future research directions, along with provided insights that are envisioned to be helpful towards the effective practical deployment of such systems. In a nutshell, this review highlights the existing and ongoing research activities for NOMA-based VLC systems, which will provide sufficient guidelines for research communities working in this domain and it will pave the way for successful deployment of these systems. © 2023 by the authors.","massive connectivity; multiple access; NOMA; resource allocation; spectral efficiency; successive interference cancellation (SIC); visible light communication","5G mobile communication systems; Antennas; Cost effectiveness; Energy efficiency; Network layers; Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing; Radio transceivers; Resource allocation; Spectrum efficiency; Wireless networks; Communications systems; Massive connectivity; Multiple access; Non-orthogonal; Non-orthogonal multiple access; Resources allocation; Spectral efficiencies; Successive interference cancelation; Successive interference cancellations; bandwidth; body height; cell proliferation; communication technology; light; machine learning; noise; practice guideline; radiofrequency; resource allocation; review; security; unmanned aerial vehicle; velocity; weather; Visible light communication","","","","","Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Cognitive Radio and Information Processing, (CRKL200106); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (62261009)","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under grant 62261009, Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Cognitive Radio and Information Processing (CRKL200106).","Tullberg H., Popovski P., Li Z., Uusitalo M.A., Hoglund A., Bulakci O., Fallgren M., Monserrat J.F., The METIS 5G System Concept: Meeting the 5G Requirements, IEEE Commun.

A unifying parallel is drawn between resource-dependent countries and regions with depleted mineral resources. The objective factors of losses of accessed reserves are analyzed. A unifying parallel is drawn between sub-standard ores and industrial waste. The paper proposes shifting geotechnology development from simple mineral extraction towards technologies that provide a full cycle of geo-resources development. A radical way of ensuring a full cycle of geo-resources development is the involvement of sub-standard ores and industrial waste in a closed processing cycle. The utilization of industrial waste without a valuable component extracting or reducing a harmful component to a background value is palliative. A comparative description of various technologies that allow extracting valuable components from sub-standard ores and industrial waste is made. The paper proposes a variant of chemical–physical technology that makes it possible to extract a valuable component from industrial waste to a minimum value. The activation of industrial waste with a disintegrator before a chemical extraction significantly increases the yield of a valuable component from 2.6 to 218.5%. A differentiated approach is needed regarding the choice of leaching solution, its percentage, as well as the leaching method and the need for activation processing of valuable components and industrial ones. The combined highly efficient physical–chemical and physical–technical technologies will ensure the maximum extraction of the valuable component from 52.6 to 98.8% in the full cycle of natural and industrial geo-resources development. © 2023 by the authors.","geo-resources; geotechnology; industrial waste; leaching; utilization","extraction method; industrial waste; leaching; mineral processing; physicochemical property; resource development","","","","","","","Alamsyah A., Ramadhani D.P., Kristanti F.T., Khairunnisa K., Transaction Network Structural Shift under Crisis: Macro and Micro Perspectives, Economies, 10, (2022); Stroykov G.A., Babyr N.V., Ilin I.V., Marchenko R.S., System of comprehensive assessment of project risks in energy industry, Int.

After exposure to salt mist, the analysis of photomicrographs showed the alignment of the surface of the polymer material. IR spectroscopy revealed a change in the chemical composition of thermoplastic polyurethane, and the appearance of a quaternary ammonium salt, which leads to an increase in the polarity of polymer macromolecules and increases the relaxation rate of the polymer material structure. An approach to modeling the natural loss of diesel fuel during storage in elastic tanks is proposed. The parameters of the model allowed us to quantify the effect of salt mist on the diffusion permeability of thermoplastic polyurethane for diesel fuel. At a storage temperature below 60°C after exposure to salt mist, the tightness time increases and the natural loss of diesel fuel decreases during storage in the tank. © 2023, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","diesel fuel permeability; salt mist; surface structure; thermoplastic polyurethane","Fuel storage; Polyurethanes; Reinforced plastics; Surface structure; Chemical compositions; Diesel fuel permeability; IR-spectroscopy; Polymer macromolecules; Polymer materials; Quaternary ammonium salt; Salt mists; Storage tank; Temporary storage; Thermoplastic polyurethanes; Diesel fuels","","","","","","","Novokshonov V.V., Musin I.N., Kimel'blat V.I., Optimising the properties of oil-resistant thermoplastic elastomer composites, Int.

The structure of the cast alloy mainly consists of two [(Al) + AlCaCu] and [(Al) + (Al,Cu)4Ca + AlCaCu] eutectics. HPT with three revolutions leads to the formation mainly of the submicrocrystalline structure, refining eutectic particles, their more homogeneous distribution in the sample bulk, segregation of calcium from AlCuCa and (Al,Cu)4Ca particles, and supersaturation of (Al) solid solution with copper. Such a structure causes strengthening of the alloy by three and a half times but also leads to its embrittlement. Subsequent annealing at 400°С allows an adequate strength-to-plasticity balance to be reached. © 2023, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","aluminum alloys; eutectic; high-pressure torsion; mechanical properties; microstructure; severe plastic deformation","Copper alloys; Eutectics; High pressure effects; Plasticity; Torsional stress; Bulk segregation; Cast alloys; Cu alloy; Effect of high pressure; Eutectic particles; High pressure torsions; Homogeneous distribution; Sample bulk; Severe plastic deformations; Submicrocrystalline structures; Aluminum alloys","","","","","","","Horita Z., Fujinami T., Nemoto M., Langdon T., Equal-channel angular pressing of commercial aluminum alloys: Grain refinement, thermal stability and tensile properties, Metall.

With the help of it, polluted air is removed from the working area and the conditioned air is supplied instead for meeting the requirements of sanitary norms for the microclimate parameters of working premises and the content of harmful substances in them. The traditional technology of air purification from welding smoke has fundamental disadvantages, the main of which is the inability to clean the air from carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide impurities. To normalize the microclimate of working areas, the volumetric air conditioning is used, which requires enormous energy costs. At the same time, the distribution of supply air does not provide for the protection of the welder from intense thermal radiation. The system of harmful substances suction from the welding station limits the freedom of the welder action. Therefore, in some cases, he is forced to raise the suction funnel above his head, as a result of what the welding smoke enters the room. It is proposed to avoid the above shortcomings by improving the system of complex protection of the air environment, containing an exhaust panel, an apparatus for cleaning and heat-moisture treatment of air with its cooling and subsequent return to the welder working area. It is advisable to use an apparatus for wet air treatment made according to the type of a packed scrubber-absorber using water with active additives of permanganate and sodium bicarbonate dissolved in it, which contribute to the dissolution and retention of toxic gases of the welding smoke in water. To increase the efficiency of air purification in this apparatus, it is proposed to use a special irrigated nozzle made of porous plastic plates, in which artificial turbulence of the air flow is carried out, which ensures its intense heat and mass transfer and temperature reduction. The use of such a device allows to implement an energy-saving technology by reducing the performance of the supply units to the minimum required level of outdoor air supply. © 2023, STC Industrial Safety CJSC.

An environmentally friendly technology for the recycling of CPSs by multi-stage methods developed at the National Research Center “Kurchatov Institute” — IREA is presented. The technology involves opening, crushing, and grinding (with mechanical activation), followed by liquid–solid leaching and liquid–liquid extraction. The target product is a powdery precipitate containing compounds of cobalt (Co), lithium (Li), manganese (Mn), nickel (Ni), etc. The grinding stage (in a ball mill or a disintegrator) leads to the destruction of the particle structure, changing their specific surface area and porosity. As a result, the intensity and efficiency of the extraction processes increase. The textural characteristics (such as specific surface area, porosity, total pore volume, micro- and mesopore volume) of crushed and powdered samples containing graphite with inclusions of Co and Li compounds are determined. The methods implemented in the Micromeritics ASAP 2020 analyzer software such as BET, t-Plot, Dubinin–Radushkevich, Dubinin–Astakhov, Horvath–Kawazoe, and BJH are used. The calculated texture characteristics can be used to optimize the extraction of the target components from a mechanically activated powder during leaching followed by extraction. © 2023, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","complex chemical power sources; crushing; grinding; low-temperature adsorption–desorption of nitrogen; mechanochemical destruction; micropores; mesopores; recycling technology; specific surface area; porosity","Crushing; Efficiency; Extraction; Grinding (machining); Leaching; Lithium compounds; Nitrogen; Recycling; Specific surface area; Temperature; Textures; Adsorption/desorption; Chemical power; Complex chemical power source; Complex chemicals; Crushing; Low-temperature adsorption–desorption of nitrogen; Lows-temperatures; Mechanochemical destruction; Mechanochemicals; Mesopore; Micropore;; Micropores; Power sources; Recycling technology; Specific surface area;; Porosity","","","","","Russian Science Foundation, RSF, (21–19–00403)","The study was sponsored by the Russian Science Foundation, according to grant No. 21–19–00403 “Studying the processes of mechanochemical destruction of cathode materials during extraction of cobalt and its compounds.”","Nazarov V.I., Gonopolsky A.M., Makarenkov D.A., Klyushenkova M.I., Popov A.P., Production of lithium hydroxide and lithium carbonate from spent lithium batteries, Coke and Chemistry, 63, 2, pp. 97-103, (2020); Chen X., Zhou T., Hydrometallurgical process for the recovery of metal values from spent lithium-ion batteries in citric acid media, Waste Management & Research, 32, 11, pp. 1083-1093, (2014); Cobalt Oxide (II, III), Pursuant to Regulation (EU) No. 1907/2006 (REACH), With Amendments 453/2010/EU, (2017); Methods for Determination of Specific External Surface Area [in Russian], Carbon for Rubber Production, 25699, pp. 2-90; Metal Powders.

The wastes of non-ferrous metallurgy sub-branches form exploitable resources, which, in addition to economic damage from incomplete metal extraction, cause environmental problems. The primary technologies for processing complex ores, which fail to provide waste-free concentration, cause an imbalance between raw material extraction and processing indicators since all the applied methods do not provide waste-free concentration processes. It is possible to increase the extraction of metals up to the background level by treating them with chemical reagent solutions at the time of formation of active mineral surfaces. There is also a tendency to involve metal leaching technologies in the exploitation of waste storages. The possibility of improving recovery rates during ore concentration provides a combination of traditional technologies with new technologies by supplementing the traditional technological chain with activator devices. The combination of traditional and new low-waste technologies will strengthen mineral safety through the rational use of the existing mineral resource base. © 2023, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","environmental problems; hydrometallurgy; low-waste technologies; mechanochemical activation; metal losses; non-ferrous metal industry; treatment processes; waste storages","Environmental technology; Hydrometallurgy; Metal recovery; Mineral resources; Ores; Waste treatment; Environmental problems; Ferrous metallurgy; Free concentration; Low-waste technology; Mechano-chemical activation; Metal loss; Non-ferrous metals industry; Treatment process; Valuable component; Waste storage; Extraction","","","","","","","Valiev N.G., Propp D., Vandyshev A.M., “Department of Mining Engineering of UGGU — 100 years, Izv, Vuzov.

It proposes a new probe-coil magnetic-field NDT, not requiring the pre-magnetization of the test object material, which is mandatory for all conventional magnetic flaw detection techniques. A new bifactor excitation of the fluxgate sensor’s sensitive element, based on double μ-transformation through the simultaneous activation of magnetic-modulating and electromagnetic-acoustic effects, is theoretically justified. The physical processes underlying the proposed technique are considered in detail, and a scheme for its practical implementation is described. The authors provide a variant of the new fluxgate’s original design, implementing the proposed excitation technique. The specifics of implementing the fluxgate operating modes are analyzed, testifying to the possibility of detecting a given class of flaws with the required coverage as well as ensuring the required diagnostic resolution during flaw detection, which, in fact, indicates a more reliable identification of both the flaw type and location. Herewith, the new fluxgate type features the advantages of improved functionality and lower cost due to its simple design. The paper also considers a method to experimentally study the capabilities of the proposed fluxgate sensor with a new bifactor excitation in detail. The results of the experimental study into its key specifications are provided, confirming its high resolution, narrower zone of uncertainty, and the possibility of detecting smaller flaws at greater depths compared to available analogs. © 2023 by the authors.","acoustic waves; eddy currents; electromagnetic acoustic effect; electromagnetic field; fluxgate converter; fluxgate sensor; permeability modulation; variable magnetic field strength","Acoustics; Eddy current testing; Eddy currents; Electric excitation; Mechanical permeability; Acoustics waves; Eddy-current; Electromagnetic-acoustic effect; Flaw detection; Fluxgate converter; Fluxgate sensor; Fluxgates; Magnetic field strengths; Permeability modulation; Variable magnetic field strength; Electromagnetic fields","","","","","","","Ishaya Z.D., Dauda M., Pam G.Y., Kulla D.M., Destructive testing and production system integrity, Adv.

The use of complementary x-ray diffraction and analysis of neutron diffraction patterns by the Rietveld method allowed reliably separating the nuclear and magnetic contributions to the intensity of the diffraction peaks and performing refinement of the Fe3Ge magnetic state characteristics. Both main phases appearing in Fe3Ge are ferromagnetic with TC=629 K (hexagonal, D019) and TC=714 K (cubic, L12). In D019, the presence of a spin-flip transition (Tsf=385 K) was confirmed and the temperature dependence of the components of magnetic moment along the hexagonal axis and in the basal plane was obtained. It was shown that the transformation between ordered L12 and D019 structural states, predicted by the equilibrium-phase diagram, includes three steps: two diffusional stages (L12→A1, A3→D019) and one displacive stage (A1→A3). The obtained structural data suggest that in Fe-Ge, as well as in Fe-Ga alloy, direct transitions between ordered phases are impossible. They should include a transition between disordered states.  © 2023 American Physical Society.

Millions of tons of hazardous spent sulfuric acid and lime mud are produced by water treatment facilities every year. Unlike other types of waste, lime mud can sometimes be used for the thermal regeneration of lime. However, this approach requires a high energy consumption and, thus, cannot be considered a sustainable or green process. Compared to the latest research, the method presented here allowed for the production of anhydrite in one step at very low temperatures and in a short time while also bypassing the stage of gypsum phase formation. Results: Calcium sulfate anhydrite was synthesized from the water treatment waste of lime mud by a low-temperature method at temperatures of 25 and 45 °С. The resulting samples were composed of anhydrite with different crystal morphologies. This was confirmed by XRD, DTA, SEM, TEM, and thermochemical calculations. Dependences of the influence of the shape of crystals on the main technological properties of anhydrite cement and the influence of additives on the activation of the binding properties were established. Conclusion: The research shows that different types of calcium sulfate anhydrite require different additives and in different amounts.

The heat and mass transfer in hydrogel materials based on agarose and gelatin with model microorganisms incubated in the bulk of the gel are studied by the optical methods of spectroscopy and microscopy. The propagation of the fronts of the nutrient medium in pure gelatin hydrogels and mixed hydrogels based on agarose with the addition of gelatin are compared to determine the diffusion properties of the mixed hydrogels that can ensure the delivery of nutrient components to microorganisms. New data are obtained on the degree of heterogeneity in the growth of microorganisms during their bulk incubation under various temperature conditions of incubation, which is necessary to control the properties of bioink in bioprinting. An analytical description of the curve of cell growth in the gel is proposed, and on its basis an expression for determining the cell growth rate is obtained. A numerical model is developed to describe the absorption of nutrients by cells during their growth. © 2023, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","cells; mass transfer; numerical model; random walk method; spectrometry method; two-component gel","Cell engineering; Cell proliferation; Gels; Growth kinetics; Hydrogels; Microorganisms; Numerical methods; Numerical models; Nutrients; Tissue engineering; Agarose; Bioprinting; Cell incubation; matrix; Random-walk method; Spectrometry method; Tissues engineerings; Two-component; Two-component gel; Unsteady state; Mass transfer","","","","","","","Wasupalli G.K., Verma D., Thermosensitive injectable hydrogel based on chitosan—polygalacturonic acid polyelectrolyte complexes for bone tissue engineering, Carbohydr.

The study aims at proposing indicators for assessing the spread of smart technologies in various spheres of human life with due regard to the introduction of open innovations. The methodological basis of the study was an approach focused on the study of the processes of development of open innovations and the smartization of society with the involvement of special methods. Special methods include document analysis based on a literature review conducted by the authors, content analysis using multiple correspondence analysis and the cluster analysis method. This is the first study to use the Smart Progress Index like other social development indices, including the Social Progress Index, the Physical Quality Life Index and the Sustainable Economic Welfare Index. The Smart Progress Index will determine the state of society and the level of its development in technological, geopolitical, socio-economic, demographic and environmental terms. There are three indicators of the Smart Progress Index: 1) the scale of smart technologies; 2) the conditions and intensity of introducing smart technologies; 3) the results of smart technologies. Each aspect includes several components represented by seventeen indicators. © 2023 WITPress.

Such membrane lifetime testing is critical to the operation of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). The crystals were obtained by the method of directional crystallization of the melt in a cold crucible. The phase composition and structure of the membranes before and after aging were studied using X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. The conductivities of the samples were measured using the impedance spectroscopy technique. The (ZrO2)0.90(Sc2O3)0.09(Yb2O3)0.01 composition showed long-term conductivity stability (conductivity degradation not more than 4%). Long-term high-temperature aging of the (ZrO2)0.90(Sc2O3)0.08(Yb2O3)0.02 composition initiates the t″ → t′ phase transformation. In this case, a sharp decrease in conductivity of up to 55% was observed. The data obtained demonstrate a clear correlation between the specific conductivity and the change in the phase composition. The (ZrO2)0.90(Sc2O3)0.09(Yb2O3)0.01 composition can be considered a promising material for practical use as a solid electrolyte in SOFCs. © 2023 by the authors.","conductivity; single crystal; SOFC; structure; zirconia membranes","Crystal structure; Membranes; Phase composition; Solid electrolytes; Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC); Zirconia; Co-doped; Conductivity; Crystals structures; Electrolytics; High-temperature ageing; Long-term conductivity; Scandia stabilized zirconia; Solid-oxide fuel cell; Zirconia membrane; ZrO 2; Single crystals","","","","","Moscow Polytechnic University; Osipyan Institute of Solid State Physics RAS","This work was financially supported by the Moscow Polytechnic University within the framework of the grant named after Pyotr Kapitsa and by the Osipyan Institute of Solid State Physics RAS state task.","Mahato N., Banerjee A., Gupta A., Omar S., Balani K., Progress in material selection for solid oxide fuel cell technology: A review, Prog.

This requires improving techniques for estimating the transformer’s health and forecasting its remaining useful life (RUL). A brief review of the problem being solved has shown that the known RUL estimation techniques include processing the results of measuring the facility state parameters using various mathematical methods. Data processing techniques (deep learning, SOLA, etc.) are used, but there is no information on their application in online monitoring systems. Herewith, fast (shock) changes in the resource caused by the failures and subsequent recoveries of the facility’s health have not been considered. This reduces the RUL forecasting accuracy for the repairable equipment, including transformers. It is especially relevant to consider the impact of sudden state changes when it comes to furnace transformers due to a cumulative wear effect determined by their frequent connections to the grid (up to 100 times a day). The proposed approach is based on calculating the RUL by analytical dependencies, considering the failures and recoveries of the facility state. For the first time, an engineering RUL forecasting technique has been developed, based on the online diagnostic monitoring data results provided in the form of time series. The equipment’s relative failure tolerance index, calculated with analytical dependencies, has first been used in RUL forecasting. As a generalized indicator, a relative failure tolerance index considering the facility’s state change dynamics has been proposed. The application of the RUL forecasting technique based on the results of dissolved gas analysis of a ladle furnace unit’s transformer is demonstrated. The changes in the transformer state during the operation period from 2014 to 2022 have been studied. The RUL was calculated in the intensive aging interval; the winding dismantling results were demonstrated, which confirmed developing destructive processes in the insulation. The key practical result of the study is reducing accidents and increasing the service life of the arc and ladle furnace transformers. The techno-economic effect aims to ensure process continuity and increase the metallurgical enterprise’s output (we cannot quantify this effect since it depends on the performance of a particular enterprise). It is recommended to use the technique to forecast the RUL of repairable facilities equipped with online monitoring systems. © 2023 by the authors.","application; forecasting; furnace transformer; online monitoring; reliability; remaining useful life (RUL); technical condition; technique","Data handling; Deep learning; Ladles; Online systems; Partial discharges; Forecasting techniques; Furnace transformers; Life-forecasting; On-line monitoring system; Online monitoring; Remaining useful life; Remaining useful lives; States change; Technical conditions; Technique; Forecasting","","","","","","","Yan W., Wang J., Lu S., Zhou M., Peng X., A Review of Real-Time Fault Diagnosis Methods for Industrial Smart Manufacturing, Processes, 11, (2023); Karandaev A.S., Yachikov I.M., Radionov A.A., Liubimov I.V., Druzhinin N.N., Khramshina E.A., Fuzzy Algorithms for Diagnosis of Furnace Transformer Insulation Condition, Energies, 15, (2022); Reboldi R., Zanoni S., Mazzoldi L., Marchi B., TAMINE TES.

The Fluorescence Recovery Protein (FRP) is used to restore photosynthetic activity by inactivating OCP via dynamic OCP-FRP interactions, a multistage process that remains underexplored. In this work, applying time-resolved spectroscopy, we demonstrate that the interaction of FRP with the photoactivated OCP begins early in the photocycle. Interacting with the compact OCP state, FRP completely prevents the possibility of OCP domain separation and formation of the signaling state capable of interacting with the antenna. The structural element that prevents FRP binding and formation of the complex is the short α-helix at the beginning of the N-terminal domain of OCP, which masks the primary site in the C-terminal domain of OCP. We determined the rate of opening of this site and show that it remains exposed long after the relaxation of the red OCP states. Observations of the OCP transitions on the ms time scale revealed that the relaxation of the orange photocycle intermediates is accompanied by an increase in the interaction of the carotenoid keto group with the hydrogen bond donor tyrosine-201. Our data refine the current model of photoinduced OCP transitions and the interaction of its intermediates with FRP. © 2023 American Chemical Society.","","Bacterial Proteins; Carotenoids; Cyanobacteria; Phycobilisomes; Signal Transduction; Spectrum Analysis; Amino acids; Antennas; Citrus fruits; Complexation; Hydrogen bonds; Proteins; Time-resolved spectroscopy; bacterial protein; carotenoid; Cyanobacterium; Fluorescence recovery; Light-harvesting complex; Photo-damage; Photocycles; Photoprotection; Protein fluorescence; Protein interaction; Time-resolved spectroscopy; Watersoluble; chemistry; cyanobacterium; metabolism; phycobilisome; signal transduction; spectroscopy; Carotenoids","","Bacterial Proteins, ; Carotenoids, ; Phycobilisomes, ","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (41906109, 42061134020); Eesti Teadusagentuur, ETAg, (PRG 539); Russian Science Foundation, RSF, (21-44-00005)","The work was supported by the Russian Science Foundation (grant number 21-44-00005) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant number 42061134020 and 41906109).

Methods and materials: The article considers the developed mathematical model of vertical oscillations of the monorail track, which allows setting the interconnection between the rolling stock parameters and dynamic loads in the suspension. At vertical oscillations of the monorail and under the effect of harmonic disturbing force caused by the movement of the suspension, the system of the monorail suspension can be represented in the form of a dual-mass system. Results: As a result, the equations for oscillation amplitudes of the monorail elements were obtained and damping coefficient of suspension was defined. The obtained results suggest setting reasonable parameters of the monorail fastening, which offers the possibility to decrease dynamic loads occurring during the operation of the mine suspended monorail tracks. The proposed monorail suspension makes it possible to reduce the dynamic loads formed during the movement of the rolling stock by 30–40% and can be used to modernize existing mine suspended monorails. Discussion: Analysis of the obtained results shows that in order to reduce the vibration amplitudes of a suspended monorail mine, it is appropriate to use suspension systems for rolling stock and a monorail track, consisting of elastic elements. The parameters required for this can be determined using the proposed method, and required rigidity of the monorail track is provided by embedding elastic supports into its suspension system. Conclusions: The obtained results allow setting reasonable parameters of the monorail fastening of the mine suspended monorail tracks. The proposed monorail suspension makes it possible to minimize the dynamic loads formed during the movement of rolling stock and can be used to modernize existing mine suspension monorails. © 2023 by the authors.","amplitude; dynamic loads; frequency; mathematical model; monorail track; oscillations; rolling stock","","","","","","","","Bao Y., Yue X., Li Y., A dynamic analysis scheme for the suspended monorail vehicle-curved bridge coupling system, Adv.

Through DR programs, users are encouraged for utilizing renewable energy and reducing their power consumption at peak times, thereby helping to balance supply and demand on the grid, as well as generating revenue from the sale of excess power. This paper presents an effective energy management layout (EML) for household DR employing Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Fuzzy Reasoning (FR). RL would be a model-free control method that consists of doing measures and assessing the outcomes as it interacts with the environments. Through direct integration of customer feedback into its control logic, the suggested method takes into account user satisfaction by utilizing FR as a reward function. Through the shift of controllable devices from peak hours, whenever energy cost is higher, to off-peak periods, whenever energy cost is low, Q-learning, an RL method according to a reward scheme, has been applied for scheduling the execution of smart home devices. With the suggested method, 14 home devices can be controlled by one agent, and many status-action pairs as well as fuzzy logic for the reward function are used to assess the actions taken for a particular status. Simulations are implemented in the digital twin environment and demonstrate that the suggested device planning method smooths the energy usage and minimizes the energy price by taking into account the consumers' satisfaction, the consumers' feedback, and their satisfaction settings. The Home EML has been presented with a consumer interface in MATLAB/Simulink for demonstrating the suggested DR approach. The simulation tools include smart devices, energy price signals, smart meters, solar photovoltaics, batteries, electric vehicle, and grid supply. © 2023 International Solar Energy Society","Demand response, digital twin; Fuzzy reasoning; Home energy management; Reinforcement learning; Solar-based smart home","Automation; Computer circuits; Customer satisfaction; E-learning; Economics; Energy management; Energy utilization; Feedback; Fuzzy logic; Learning systems; MATLAB; Solar power generation; Demand response; Demand response programs; Demand response, digital twin; Effective energy; Fuzzy reasoning; Home energy managements; Reinforcement learnings; Reward function; Smart homes; Solar-based smart home; cost analysis; demand analysis; energy management; fuzzy mathematics; household survey; learning; planning method; simulation; Reinforcement learning","","","","","","","Alsokhiry F., Annuk A., Mohamed M.A., Marinho M., An Innovative Cloud-Fog-Based Smart Grid Scheme for Efficient Resource Utilization, Sensors, 23, 4, (2023); Shojaeiyan S., Niknam T., Nafar M., A novel bio-inspired stochastic framework to solve energy management problem in hybrid AC-DC microgrids with uncertainty, Int.

One of the consequences of using this flat bar without controlled coil chilling (CCC) is an uneven relation of the mechanical properties of the main metal and the welded joint, which raises doubt about the possibility to eliminate this inconsistency by subsequent heat treatment. The study results show the need for optimizing the chilling of finished hot-rolled coiled material to reach a stable level of physical mechanical properties of items, where this material is used as the source material for producing cold-rolled products, pipes, metalware, etc. © 2023, Allerton Press, Inc.","controlled coil chilling (CCC); fracture; hot rolling; residual stresses; welded joint","Cold rolling; Hot rolled steel; Metal cladding; Residual stresses; Steel sheet; Steelmaking; Strip metal; Welding; Welds; A-stable; Controled coil chilling; Hot rolled sheets; Hot-rolled; Joint zone; Physical-mechanical properties; Plate steel; Rolled plates; Sheet steel; Steel production; Hot rolling","","","","","","","Good H.H., Machol R.E., System Engineering: An Introduction to the Design of Large-Scale Systems, (1957); Chashchin V.V., Analysis of variation of heat content of metal at hot rolling at wideband mills, Chern.

The forms of the goaf are classified. An algorithm was developed for air distribution in emergency ventilation mode, including when the main ventilation fan is turned on after an emergency stop. The possibilities and mechanism of the fan influence at the stages of ventilation in emergency conditions was clarified. An algorithm is proposed for calculating ventilation parameters in case of emergency reversion of the ventilation jet. The methods for calculating the amount of air and the inertia of the ventilation system are presented at normal ventilation and during the transition from normal ventilation to emergency. The problem of air distribution during the transition period is solved with the representation of the air branch in the form of a node with multidirectional and limited movement of air jets. The methodology for predicting hazardous working situations is detailed based on the laws of diffusion transfer of gas components of the mine atmosphere. A new method of experimental determination of elements of the transitional period of ventilation was developed. The results are given concerning the study of the influence of the goaf on the efficiency of the fans operation and the duration of the transition process after reversing the fan in an emergency. A new idea is substantiated related to the gas situation as a fragment of a ventilation network with distributed sources of oxygen absorption and gas release. The structure of the matrix of the state of mine workings in an emergency was proposed. An algorithm for calculating ventilation modes for optimizing emergency response plans is formulated. It is shown that the establishment of the regularity of the processes of gas transfer during emergency ventilation mode allows to increase the efficiency of measures to ensure occupational safety in underground mining. © 2023, STC Industrial Safety CJSC.

The saturation magnetization and remanence showed non-monotonic dependences on Cu concentration in samples. The coercive force was varied from 110 to 177Oe depending on Cu content in nanoparticles. The correlation between magnetic properties and microstructure of Ni-Co-Cu/carbon nanocomposites was discussed assuming the transition of nanoparticles to superparamagnetic and single-domain states depending on their sizes.  © 2023 World Scientific Publishing Company.","magnetic properties; Ni-Co-Cu/carbon nanocomposite; pyrolysis; synthesis","Cobalt; Cobalt alloys; Copper; Electromagnetic wave absorption; Magnetic materials; Microstructure; Nanocomposites; Particle size; Pyrolysis; Remanence; Saturation magnetization; Synthesis (chemical); Average size; Carbon nanocomposite; Cu concentrations; Magnetic nanocomposites; Nanocomposite synthesis; Ni-co-cu/carbon nanocomposite; Solid-solution nanoparticles; Synthesis conditions; Synthesis method; [Co/Cu]; Magnetic properties","","","","","Valiev Institute of Physics and Technology of Yaroslavl Branch, Russian Academy of Sciences, YB IPT RAS, (FFNN-2022-0019)","The research was carried out within the framework of the State assignment # 075-00268-20-02 (ID: 0718-2020-0040) on the topic ""Complex processing of hydrocarbons to produce hydrogen-containing gases and precursors of composite materials for additive manufacturing"", the State assignments for: Valiev Institute of Physics and Technology of RAS (Program no.

The liquidus projection of the Al-Ca-Cu system in the aluminum corner has been suggested based on experiential studies of the microstructure and phase composition of model alloys. The suggested structure of the diagram has two quasi-binary sections: (Al)-Al27Ca3Cu7 and (Al)-Al8CaCu4 and three invariant eutectic transformations: L→(Al) + (Al,Cu)4Ca + Al27Ca3Cu7 (at 5.6 wt.% Ca, 4.5 wt.% Cu, 595 °C), L→(Al) + Al27Ca3Cu7 + Al8CaCu4 (at 2.2 wt.% Ca, 13.5 wt.% Cu, 594 °C) and L→(Al) + Al8CaCu4 + Al2Cu (at 0.5 wt.% Ca, 34 wt.% Cu, 544 °C). The limit solubility of copper in aluminum solid solution (Al) at 530 °C reaches ~5.1 wt.% in the ternary phase field (Al) + Al8CaCu4 + Al2Cu and drops to ~2.4 wt.% in the (Al) + Al8CaCu4 + Al27Ca3Cu7 ternary phase field. For the example of the model ternary hypoeutectic alloys with a predominant content of the eutectic (Al,Cu)4Ca phase, it has been shown that the system is promising for designing new eutectic-type alloys with a natural composite structure. © 2023 by the authors.","Al-Ca-Cu system; intermetallics; microstructure; phase diagram","","","","","","Moscow Polytechnic University","This work was financially supported by the Moscow Polytechnic University within the framework of the grant named after Pyotr Kapitsa.","Polmear I.J., Couper M.J., Design and development of an experimental wrought aluminum alloy for use at elevated temperatures, Metall.

Damage to these units is often caused by corrosion, with localized corrosion being the most dangerous. In the case under consideration, when the metal is simultaneously affected by a corrosive environment and alternating mechanical loads, conditions arise for the occurrence of corrosion fatigue. The prospects of cathodic electrochemical protection of these units are considered in the paper. Since the cooling systems and propellers are made of copper alloys, the effect was studied concerning the potential and composition of the solution on the corrosion of the main component of the structural material — copper. Copper samples with a smooth mechanical pressure concentrator cantilevered in a fluoroplastic electrochemical cell were tested. Alternating bending loads were applied to them, and the number of load cycles before the destruction of the sample (durability) was determined. The experiments were carried out in deaerated solutions of the surfactantly inactive electrolyte NaF, as well as fluoride solutions with additives of surfactants and organic surfactants — benzotriazole. At the same time, an interval of potentials was set, in which the only Faraday process is possible — the reduction of traces of dissolved oxygen. It was found that at potentials less than the zero charge potential, the durability of copper increases significantly. And the introduction of chloride ions and benzotriazole into the solution, on the contrary, leads to a strong decrease in its durability. The potential of zero charge of copper was determined from the measurement data of the differential capacitance of the metal in sodium fluoride solutions with different concentrations of fluoride. The increase in the durability of the metal is explained by the occurrence of hydrogen bonds between the water molecules adsorbed by the hydrogen atoms. This manifests the so-called negative Rebinder effect. For electrochemical protection, the potential range is recommended below the potential of zero charge of the metal, but above the potential of water decomposition. For cooling systems, it is recommended to use deionized water as a coolant. © 2023, STC Industrial Safety CJSC.

This article is devoted to the consideration of the views of the outstanding Russian historian I.E. Zabelin on the role of the concept of “nationality” and “folk life” in relation to archaeology. The task of reconstructing the scientist's ideas related to determining the place of archeology in the life of society and the nature of science is solved on the basis of unpublished archival materials. In the course of the study, new accents were placed in his assessment as an archaeologist, teacher, citizen, what is the novelty of this work. The materials of this study were handwritten lecture notes compiled by E.I. Zabelin in the 1860s, for reading in front of an audience consisting of artists, as well as diaries and autobiography of the scientist. In historiography, the work of I.E. Zabelin was not considered in the perspective chosen in this article. In his lectures, I.E. Zabelin argues that modern ideas can be realized only by referring to the heroic past of the people. By “nationality” in archaeology, a scientist understands the study of both the material and spiritual culture of the past. Based on the history of archeology, the researcher points out the need to study not only classical antiquities, but also monuments of other peoples. Innovative are his reflections on the «living» and “dead” ways of developing archaeology as a science. The development of archaeological knowledge in Russia, for reasons not always of an academic nature, followed a “dead” path, which led to small-scale, regional-chronological isolation, and emphasized the empirical nature of research. The thesis of the unity of historical and archaeological knowledge has entered into the tradition of Russian science. I.E. Zabelin in his lectures was repeatedly ahead of his time, justifying the use of the term “type” of archeology, advocating a combination of archaeological practice and theory, defending the need to study all aspects of folk life. In Russian science, this was talked about more than a century after the lectures of I.E. Zabelin. Copyright © 2023 by Cherkas Global University.","history of archeology; I.E.

The current directions of development and characteristics of the Russian economy are considered. Methods: The authors conducted a comparative analysis of the most relevant and popular scientific theories and practical approaches to innovation currently available. Results: The main trends in the development and implementation of key significant socioeconomic processes are continuous and dynamic technological changes in all spheres of life of a modern person and society. This entails a change in the life cycle of goods and services in the direction of reducing its duration, an increase in the risks of entrepreneurial activity carried out in a turbulent environment, and high unpredictability of the results of adoption and implementation management decisions caused by the lability of social needs and competition. In the current situation, innovation becomes a key component at all stages of social reproduction, as well as all socially significant social processes. On the one hand, innovation contributes to evolutionary development and scientific and technological progress, which defines it as a necessary condition for development. On the other hand, it is a source of new threats to humanity and society. Conclusions: The welfare of society and the observance of national interests, such as technological and intellectual independence, depend on the effectiveness of ensuring and implementing this condition, which determines the development of not only the economy but also the possibility of achieving technological security. Innovation is a key condition for economic and social development both at the macro level (state) and at the level of an enterprise (micro level), determining its competitiveness, development prospects, and financial stability. © 2023, Centro Universitario Curitiba - UNICURITIBA.

AMC with 0.5 wt% nanodiamonds addition was prepared by mechanical mixing, while AMC with 0.5 wt% of multi-layered graphene was prepared by electrochemical deposition. Initial powders for LPBF were thoroughly characterized and optimal LPBF parameters were found based on the relative density analysis and optical microscopy. Processing windows of both AMCs moved towards lower energy density possibly due to the increased total absorptivity of the powders. Raman spectroscopy results, SEM and HRTEM studies of samples after LPBF demonstrated the absence of nano-diamond in the structure after processing which is explained by graphitization of the nanodiamond particles during laser melting. In case of AMC with graphene additives, carbon-containing particles remained in the structure with partial in situ formation of Al4C3, along with a noticeable strengthening effect, which increased material's microhardness by more than 40% compared to the initial AlSi10Mg alloy. The strengthening effect is explained by the presence of a network of graphene and Al4C3 particles across the solidified melt-pool promoting the Orowan strengthening mechanism. © 2023 The Authors","Additive manufacturing; Aluminum matrix composites; Composites; Graphene; Laser powder bed fusion; Nano-diamond","3D printing; Additives; Aluminum; Aluminum compounds; Electrochemical deposition; Graphene; Nanodiamonds; Powders; Silicon; Aluminium matrix composites; Electrochemical deposition; Laser powder bed fusion; Laser powders; Mechanical mixing; Multi-layered graphene; Nano-diamond; Powder bed; Relative density; Strengthening effect; Reduction","","","","","Russian Science Foundation, RSF, (19-79-30025)","The author acknowledge Mr. Elia Poli for his support in the LPBF processing of the AMC material, and the characterization of samples.

The fire hazard increases with an increase in the mining depth. Currently, most accidents in coal mines are mine fires. The cost of eliminating mine fires is 80–95% of the cost of eliminating all accidents occurring at mining enterprises. Therefore, the problem of developing a new methodology for modeling the ventilation network parameters of the mine to increase the reliability of controlling the aerogas mode at the excavation site is very relevant. The comprehensive analysis and assessment of gas-dynamic processes in coalmines under study were carried out using the methods of probability theory and mathematical statistics. Spatial data were processed using spline interpolation in “gnuplot”. As a result, a generalized expression for the transfer functions of coalmine objects, taking into account delays, was developed, including the description of dynamic properties of mining sites under various operating modes. The principal possibility of using a graphical method for estimating additional parameters of the sections of the ventilation system branches has been proved due to the alignment of their profiles at an equivalent distance relative to an arbitrary analogue. The improved method of spatial modeling was used to determine the gas-dynamic characteristics through additive gas-dynamic processes. The studies have been carried out and the method for managing the process of changing connections between devices (controllers–switches) of the technical system was developed in order to obtain greater reliability for safe mining. In subsequent studies, there is an issue of more detailed clarification of the peculiarities concerning the interrelations between the studied parameters in several projections of the response space. © 2023 by the authors.","coal bed methane; coal mine; explosion safety; fires","","","","","","","","Miao D., Lv Y., Yu K., Liu L., Jiang J., Research on coal mine hidden danger analysis and risk early warning technology based on data mining in China, Process.

Since the Internet serves as the key hub for connection and data sharing, its open nature presents security and privacy concerns and should be considered when integrating this technology into the current global healthcare system. Cybercriminals target the TMIS because it holds a lot of sensitive patient data, including medical records, personal information, and financial information. As a result, when developing a trustworthy TMIS, strict security procedures are required to deal with these concerns. Several researchers have proposed smart card-based mutual authentication methods to prevent such security attacks, indicating that this will be the preferred method for TMIS security with the IoT. In the existing literature, such methods are typically developed using computationally expensive procedures, such as bilinear pairing, elliptic curve operations, etc., which are unsuitable for biomedical devices with limited resources. Using the concept of hyperelliptic curve cryptography (HECC), we propose a new solution: a smart card-based two-factor mutual authentication scheme. In this new scheme, HECC’s finest properties, such as compact parameters and key sizes, are utilized to enhance the real-time performance of an IoT-based TMIS system. The results of a security analysis indicate that the newly contributed scheme is resistant to a wide variety of cryptographic attacks. A comparison of computation and communication costs demonstrates that the proposed scheme is more cost-effective than existing schemes. © 2023 by the authors.","hyperelliptic curve cryptography; internet of things; mutual authentication; smart card; telecare medicine information system","Computer Security; Confidentiality; Health Smart Cards; Humans; Internet; Telemedicine; Authentication; Bioinformatics; Cost effectiveness; Geometry; Health care; Hospital data processing; Information use; Internet of things; Medical information systems; Public key cryptography; Sensitive data; Authentication scheme; Data Sharing; Healthcare services; Hyperelliptic curve cryptographies; Mutual authentication; Privacy concerns; Security and privacy; Telecare; Telecare medicine information system; Time zones; computer security; confidentiality; human; Internet; telemedicine; Smart cards","","","","","","","Ullah I., Khan M.A., Abdullah A.M., Noor F., Innab N., Chen C.-M., Enabling Secure Communication in Wireless Body Area Networks with Heterogeneous Authentication Scheme, Sensors, 23, (2023); Ullah I., Zeadally S., Amin N.U., Khan M.A., Khattak H., Lightweight and provable secure cross-domain access control scheme for Internet of things (IoT) based wireless body area networks (WBAN), Microprocess.

Nevertheless, the fact that there are a large number of working conditions, and the ongoing development of science and technology, require continuous improvement and specification of the models intended for crushing processes and those of the devices concerned. However, there are few studies related to single-roll gyratory crushers. Such crushers are promising for use in mines to crush rocks laid in the developed space. Mathematical modeling and optimization of the design parameters of the working chamber and the executive body (roll) of a single-roll gyratory shaft crusher, designed for crushing strong rocks, was performed in this paper. A differential equation was derived. As a result of its solution, the rational shape of the working chamber cheek of the single-roll gyratory crusher was established, representing a logarithmic spiral arc. Analytical expressions were derived to determine the rational rotation speed and productivity of the crusher under consideration. Expressions for calculating the kinematic load components acting on the roll were formulated. They are the periodic functions of the shaft rotation angle. The Fourier series expansion showed that the loads contained harmonics of the first, second, third and fourth orders. Using the concept of fuzzy sets, a multi-criteria optimization of the design parameters of the working chamber was performed, including the values of the eccentricity and the central angle of the beginning of the cheek profile. The variation coefficients of the kinematic components of the loads acting on the working body reduced, due to the optimal choice of the working chamber profile and the angular coordinates of the installation of the fixed cheeks. The torque reduced 1.67 times, while the radial load decreased 1.2 times. © 2023 by the authors.","first-order differential equation; Fourier series; fuzzy sets; kinematic components; multi-criteria optimization; performance; single-roll gyratory crusher; working chamber","","","","","","","","Rylnikova M.V., Angelov V.A., Turkin I.S., Features of technological and constructive solutions for the disposal of ore mining and processing waste in the worked-out space of mines, Min.

Metallurgical plants require a solution to implement in the rolling mill retrofitting. A conceptual approach to the virtual configuration of industrial mechatronic complexes based on object-oriented digital twins-prototypes and twins-instances of electromechanical and hydraulic systems is justified. Alternative options for virtual commissioning (VC) were considered, and the Hardware-In-The-Loop (HIL) option was adopted, involving the implementation of DTs in the hardware and software of a programmable logic controller (PLC). Virtual models were built, and control algorithms were tested in the Matlab Simulink software; the prospect of using Simscape domains was noted. The paper’s contribution is the description of a methodology for the development of object-oriented DTs, interlinked in the process, exemplified by a rolling mill coiler. The results of the control over the ‘virtual reeling’ mode are provided; the adequacy of real and virtual processes is confirmed. The problem of developing DTs for a coiler group, solved herein, is a fragment of a large-scale scientific and practical problem of developing DTAs (digital twin aggregates) for interconnected mechatronic rolling mill complexes. The developed VC methodology and proposed DTs are recommended for the commercial implementation in various industrial units. Developing frameworks of mechatronic systems and multi-domain DTE (Digital Twin Environment) applications are shown as prospects for future research. © 2023 by the authors.","coiler; concept; development; digital twin; implementation; mechatronic system; rolling mill; smart production; virtual commissioning","","","","","","Moscow Polytechnic University","This work was financially supported by the Moscow Polytechnic University within the frame-work of the grant named after Pyotr Kapitsa.","Konstantinov S., Assad F., Ahmad B., Vera D.A., Harrison R., Virtual Engineering and Commissioning to Support the Lifecycle of a Manufacturing Assembly System, Machines, 10, (2022); Tao F., Zhang H., Liu A., Nee A.Y.C., Digital Twin in Industry: State-of-the-Art, IEEE Trans.

Box 70270, Ibb, Yemen","Detection and monitoring of airborne hazards using e-noses has been lifesaving and prevented accidents in real-world scenarios. E-noses generate unique signature patterns for various volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and, by leveraging artificial intelligence, detect the presence of various VOCs, gases, and smokes onsite. Widespread monitoring of airborne hazards across many remote locations is possible by creating a network of gas sensors using Internet connectivity, which consumes significant power. Long-range (LoRa)-based wireless networks do not require Internet connectivity while operating independently. Therefore, we propose a networked intelligent gas sensor system (N-IGSS) which uses a LoRa low-power wide-area networking protocol for real-time airborne pollution hazard detection and monitoring. We developed a gas sensor node by using an array of seven cross-selective tin-oxide-based metal-oxide semiconductor (MOX) gas sensor elements interfaced with a low-power microcontroller and a LoRa module. Experimentally, we exposed the sensor node to six classes i.e., five VOCs plus ambient air and as released by burning samples of tobacco, paints, carpets, alcohol, and incense sticks. Using the proposed two-stage analysis space transformation approach, the captured dataset was first preprocessed using the standardized linear discriminant analysis (SLDA) method. Four different classifiers, namely AdaBoost, XGBoost, Random Forest (RF), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), were then trained and tested in the SLDA transformation space. The proposed N-IGSS achieved “all correct” identification of 30 unknown test samples with a low mean squared error (MSE) of 1.42 × 10−4 over a distance of 590 m. © 2023 by the authors.","airborne pollution hazard; intelligent gas sensor system (IGSS); Internet of Things (IoT); long range (LoRa); low-power wide-area network (LPWAN)","Chemical sensors; Discriminant analysis; Gas detectors; Gases; Low power electronics; Nitrogen oxides; Oxide semiconductors; Phase interfaces; Volatile organic compounds; Wide area networks; Airborne hazards; Airborne pollution hazard; Gas sensor systems; Intelligent gas sensor system; Internet of thing; Long range; Low Power; Low-power wide-area network; Pollution hazards; Wide-area networks; Internet of things","","","","","","","Household Air Pollution and Health; Kumar P., Imam B., Footprints of air pollution and changing environment on the sustainability of built infrastructure, Sci.

As a result of applying a method of intensive prototyping, the optimal design of the photobioreactor is found, and the maximum growth rate of 32 mg/L/day is achieved (against 8 mg/L/day in the case of control cultivation in a luminostat). The total protein content in the biomass obtained from the unit is 21 ± 6%, which is slightly lower when compared to the control (26 ± 6%); however, the revealed differences are not statistically significant.

With the increase of Mn content from 0.4 wt. % to 1.2 wt. %, the volume fraction of dynamically recrystallized (DRXed) grains decreases from 89% to 40%, while the DRXed grain size decreases from 3.2 μm to 1.9 μm. The segregation of Mn atoms and nano α-Mn dynamical precipitates are observed at the grain boundaries of the extruded Mg-0.8Mn alloys and the amount of dynamically precipitates is increased with increasing Mn content. Tensile tests show that the Mn content significantly affects mechanical properties at room temperature (RT). The Mg-0.8 wt. % Mn alloy shows the excellent ductility of 81 % at room temperature in a strain rate of 1 · 10−3 s−1, the ductility decreases if the Mn content is lower or higher than 0.8 wt. %. The yield strength (YS) and ultimate tensile strength (UTS) increase with increasing Mn content. The large value of strain rate sensitivity exponent (m-value) and small activation volume (V*) of the as-extruded Mg-0.8Mn alloy suggest that grain boundary sliding (GBS) plays an important role in tensile plastic deformation. High volume fraction of the un-DRXed region leads to the reduced contribution of GBS to plastic deformation, decreases ductility at RT. The Atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis indicates that the contribution of GBS to the total plastic deformation is 2.7 %, 55.1 % and 12.8 % for Mg-0.4Mn, Mg-0.8Mn and Mg-1.2Mn alloys, respectively. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Extrusion; Grain boundary sliding; Mg-Mn alloy; Nano precipitates; Superior ductility","Binary alloys; Ductility; Extrusion; Grain boundary sliding; Manganese alloys; Plastic deformation; Strain rate; Tensile strength; Tensile testing; Volume fraction; As-extruded; Effect of Mn; Grain boundaries sliding; Grain-boundaries; Grainsize; Microstructures and mechanical properties; Mn atoms; Mn content; Nanoprecipitate; Superior ductility; Magnesium alloys","","","","","National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (51771062, 51971076, U21A2047); National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC, (2022YFE0109600)","This work is supported by National Key Research and Development Program of China (No. 2022YFE0109600 ), and National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51971076 , No. U21A2047 and No. 51771062 ).","Pollock T.M., Weight loss with magnesium alloys, Science, 328, pp. 986-987, (2010); Yamashita A., Horita Z., Langdon T.G., Improving the mechanical properties of magnesium and a magnesium alloy through severe plastic deformation, Mater.

The most interesting among them is the case when the radiative transition is accelerated by the configurational transformation of a structural unit where it occurs. Impurity-induced VUV excitation bands of doped Li2B4O7 are attributed to the creation of impurity-bound excitons. When Mn2+ is involved into exciton recombination, the radiative transition in the Mn2+ 3d5 configuration is accelerated and occurs on a sub-nanosecond time scale. Excitation within the UV bands is connected with energy transfer from the structural units formed by the sensitizers (Cu, Sn) and oxygen to Mn2+. In this case, Mn2+ transitions are not accelerated since its excited state appears after complete relaxation of excitation in the corresponding sensitizer's unit. Pulsed cathodoluminescence decays are rather slow due to very slow transport of electron–hole pairs and excitons in Li2B4O7. © 2023 The Author(s)","Impurity-bound exciton; Li<sub>2</sub>B<sub>4</sub>O<sub>7</sub>: Cu/Mn; Li<sub>2</sub>B<sub>4</sub>O<sub>7</sub>: Mn; Li<sub>2</sub>B<sub>4</sub>O<sub>7</sub>: Sn/Mn; Ultrafast luminescence","Energy transfer; Excited states; Excitons; Lithium compounds; Bound exciton; Energy-transfer; Impurity-bound exciton; Li2B4O7: cu/mn; Li2B4O7: mn; Li2B4O7: sn/mn; Radiative transitions; Structural unit; Ultra-fast; Ultrafast luminescence; Luminescence","","","","","Eesti Teadusagentuur, ETAg, (PUT PRG111); Russian Science Foundation, RSF, (17-72-20088-p); European Regional Development Fund, ERDF, (MK-418.2022.1.2, TK134)","S.A.

Covering the years from 1922 to 1929 and gleaned from the annals of the Gorky Institute of World Literature (IMLI RAN) and Russian State Archive of Literature and Art (RGALI), it is supplied with an introduction and comments. The epistolary friendship of the two writers resulted from common interests and acquaintances in the literary world as well as the critic Zamyatin’s backing of Novikov in the 1924 article ‘On the current and the contemporary’ [‘O segodnyashnem i o sovremennom’]. In their letters, Novikov and Zamyatin bemoaned censorship and shared updates about new projects and upcoming productions of their plays, and discussed the life of literary organizations in Leningrad and Moscow as well as anthologies published in Leningrad. Stigmatized as a ‘fellow traveller’ (poputchik) during the 1929 persecution campaign, Zamyatin turned to Novikov in search for a like-minded supporter who would stand by him in print. The published correspondence offers a glimpse into the 1920s historical and ideological climate of Moscow and Petrograd-Leningrad, as well as the literary and theatrical process of the period. © 2023 Voprosy Literatury.

The subject of the study is statistical data characterizing the effectiveness of change management in the draft strategy for the development of light industry in the Russian Federation for the period up to 2025. The methodological basis of the study was general scientific methods of cognition (methods of structural and functional analysis, dialectical, logical unity, traditional methods of economic analysis and synthesis), as well as specific methods of assessing the state of the strategy for the development of light industry for the period up to 2025. The main problems in the light industry of the Russian Federation at the present time are analyzed. A simple and cross-matrix SWOT analysis of the light industry of the Russian Federation has been developed. A change management project was developed within the framework of the light industry development strategy in the Russian Federation for the period up to 2025 using the 4P ""Results Orientation"" approach (project - project, purpose - goals and intentions, particulars - in particular, people - people). It is established that the modern problems of managing changes in the draft Strategy are: high dependence of the industry on imported components and macroeconomic instability; unrealized opportunities to attract qualified specialists to the industry, as well as to raise the prestige of the industry with the help of wages; the presence of a single production chain – synthetic materials. © 2023 Ivanovo State University of Chemistry and Technology.

The authors address the issues of developing a methodology for assessing spatiotemporal changes in cracking in natural and technical systems. The research methodology consisted of an integrated approach, including: analysis of literary sources; processing of field data on the width of cracks on the surface of the slope system using the photogrammetric method; use of LOESS smoothing methods, three-dimensional b-spline interpolation and construction of response surfaces in Gnuplot software, as well as other calculations in MS Excel. The paper presents the results of studies of deformation processes in natural-technical systems. It was found that the width of the crack walls increases nonlinearly depending on the length of the crack towards higher values of picket numbers, while the magnitude of absolute displacements (in 2023) for local maxima is in the range of 4-16 mm, and for a local minimum - 50-52 mm. In addition, as a result of the monitoring, it was established that the minimum values of the average annual displacement rate of individual sections of the walls of the cracks under study are 7.5% per year, and the maximum values are 21.8% per year. © 2023 Publishing house Mining book.

Based on the analysis of large international cohorts, the criteria for granulomatosis with polyangiitis and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis were revised, and classification criteria for microscopic polyangiitis were proposed for the first time. The creation’s history of the AAV classification criteria is discussed over the past three decades, and their limitations are considered. It should be noted, the ACR/EULAR 2022 criteria were developed for creating homogeneous groups of patients for scientific studies and cannot be widely used in clinical practice for the various AAV nosological forms diagnosis, primarily at early stage of the disease or mono organ damage (for example, kidneys). As before, decisive importance in AVV diagnostic belong to a detailed clinical analysis and a complete examination of patients to identify pathognomonic symptoms, including asymptomatic ones. © 2023 Ima-Press Publishing House.

Thereby researchers begin to take an active interest in this topic, and number of publications on service learning in the Russian context is growing. We are witnessing the emergence of a new area of educational research in our country. Under these circumstances, it is necessary to evaluate the successes in scientific knowledge, identify the existing gaps, and develop a programme for further research on service learning in our country. This circumstance determined the author’s interest in this topic and the choice of methodology in favour of a systematic review of the subject field. As a result, the author was able to identify an array of relevant publications, reconstruct the subject field, and identify seven main themes that have been covered to varying degrees in the literature: 1) specificity of the approach; 2) civicism formation; 3) application of reflective practices; 4) use of an evidence-based approach; 5) conceptualization; 6) external partners; and 7) the role of the teacher. The content analysis of the materials made it possible to identify the main characteristics of the publication array, identify lacunas and propose a programme of further research. © 2023 Moscow Polytechnic University.

The features of the application of BigData methods are considered, in particular, the use of an ensemble of computer vision algorithms and the mathematical apparatus of convolutional neural networks for the timely detection of emergency situations in parking lots by means of mobile robots. Implemented training of convolutional neural networks on the MobileNetV2, ResNet50 and DenseNet121 architectures with the addition of Squeeze-and-Excitation block (SE) to solve the problem of identifying semantic signs of vehicle damage in parking lots. The methods improved using the SE block made it possible to increase the accuracy by 2–3%, which amounted to 88%, 91% and 92%, respectively. At the second stage of work, when training neural networks, about 20% of the images obtained in difficult video shooting conditions (at dusk, during rain, snow, etc.) were used. The results of testing retrained neural networks on images obtained in difficult video conditions were compared with the method based on the HOG descriptor selected by us for similar conditions (a combined approach based on directional gradient histograms, the bag-of-visual-words method, and a neural network of inverse distribution). Compared with the comparable method, DenseNet121 + SE showed an accuracy of 86%, which is the same as the accuracy of the HOG-BoVW-BPNN method, but the speed of DenseNet121 + SE is 40% faster, which makes it a more attractive method for a car park computer vision system. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.","Big data; Car parking; Convolutions; Information processes; Information security; Mobile robots; Neural networks; Security management; Security systems","Accident prevention; Big data; Computer vision; Convolutional neural networks; Information management; Inverse problems; Learning systems; Machine learning; Mobile robots; Network security; Security systems; Semantics; Car parking; Condition; Convolutional neural network; Industrial robotic systems; Information process; Machine learning methods; Neural-networks; Parking lots; Russian federation; Security management; Convolution","","","","","","","Suthir S., Harshavardhanan P., Subramani K., Senthil P., Veena T., Faith S.J., Nivethitha V., Conceptual approach on smart car parking system for industry 4.0 internet of things assisted networks, Meas.

I. Shamova, Moscow Pedagogical State University, Moscow, Russian Federation","Introduction. The relevance of the study is due to the fact that the psychological safety of people with disabilities and other subjects of the educational environment is the leading characteristic that determines its developmental nature. The aim of this study was to examine the students’ opinion about the capabilities and abilities of people with disabilities or impairments (PWDs) and the formation of a tolerant attitude towards them, i.e. their social and psychological safety. Materials and methods. The study was carried out on the basis of the Voronezh State Industrial and Humanitarian College (Russian Federation). 1000 people took part in the survey (among those were 46.3% of male and 53.7% of female). Methods of study: questionnaire; the Spearman correlation coefficient analysis; principal component method; semantic analysis. Results. The problem of psychological safety for people with disabilities was partially covered at the stage of the ascertaining experiment. The analysis of experimental data obtained as a result of the survey showed that at the time of the survey 77.7% of respondents by gender (42.2% – men, 35.4% – women) treat people with disabilities as ordinary people, recognizing their skills, dignity and abilities. 12.6% of respondents treat PWDs as people in constant need of help (6,8% – men, 5,8% – women), 4.8% of respondents feel sorry for PWDs (2,5% – men and 2,3% – women). Conclusion. The results of the factor analysis revealed the main factor, i.e. “tolerant attitude towards people with disabilities”, which does not depend on the age or gender characteristics of the respondents. Usually this attitude is formed as a result of communication with them (i.e. with persons with disabilities). All respondents intend to treat people with disabilities as equal who deserve to live like everyone else, and at the same time as people with additional (special) needs not impairments. © 2023 LLC Ecological Help.

There are several ways to dispose of used oils:regeneration, burial and incineration. The burning of waste oils is widespread both in Russia and abroad. One of the significant disadvantages of the method is the entry of harmful substances into the atmosphere. The results of research on the development of a more advanced installation of thermal utilization of waste oils, ensuring the completeness of combustion and reduction of harmful emissions, are presented. The unit for thermal disposal of waste oils consists of a furnace and an emulsion nozzle. The furnace from the furnace chamber and the afterburning chamber of the flue gas provides two-zone, two-stage oil gorenje. Oil is burned in the combustion chamber (1st gorenje zone with t ≈ 600–700оC). Then the smoke enters the afterburning chamber, where it is completely burned due to the supply of additional air (2nd gorenje zone with t ≈ 1200–1300оC), due to the increase in temperature, toxic substances contained in the smoke are transformed into harmless due to their complete oxidation. The emulsion nozzle consists of intersecting grooves, which, when air and heated oil are fed into it, provide finely dispersed oil spraying by forming gas-liquid vortices in the oncoming grooves. Using the ANSYS program, the calculation of the flame angle of the emulsion nozzle was carried out. It is established that to change the range of the spraying torch and the use of emulsion nozzles in furnaces of different volume and power, it is necessary to change the angle of the screw direction. This research contributes to the development of the industry of processing of production and consumption waste. The proposed solution allows the installation to be used not only in industrial centers where significant volumes of waste oils accumulate, but also in sparsely populated areas, and also ensures the completeness of combustion of oil waste and reduces the negative impact on the environment. © 2023 Publishing House ""O-Kratkoe"".

One of the vibration methods for processing loose finely dispersed mineral raw materials is the sepIntroduction. The quality of powder materials made of rare metals is ensured by chemical-thermal treatment, including diffusion chromosilidation. Chemical and thermal treatment of products intensifies the process of diffusion saturation, reduces the processing time and allows the use of products in aggressive and abrasive environments. Methods and materials of research. Systematization, generalization and analysis of theoretical, laboratory and experimental studies, the basis of which is the modeling of processes. Research results. It was found that when using low-alloyed powder, higher strength and viscosity indices of chromosilicated materials were obtained. It is determined that the mechanical properties of powders processed from molten salts are higher than those of materials from powder filling. It is shown that the treatment increases the corrosion resistance of iron-based powders with an established corrosion rate less than the initial one. Discussion of research results. The rapid formation of an oxide film that protects the metal from corrosion is facilitated by quenching and normalization. Porous chromosilicated layers are destroyed and impair the ability of the material to resist corrosion destruction. The operational properties of chromosilicated powders obtained by hot stamping methods increase when using rational parameters of the technological process in an optimal mode. Conclusion. The article contains new proposals for managing the properties of materials to increase corrosion resistance and wear resistance of children. Conclusions on the article. New developments can be recommended for implementation in the production of rare metals and products made from them. Suggestions. The results of the research can be used both in the modernization of production and in the training of specialists in this field. © 2023 North Caucasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, State Technological University.

Cast iron is a widely used material in mechanical engineering, mining and other industries. Modification of the surface properties of cast iron by ion implantation is of great interest. Research methods and materials. Samples of cast iron before and after implantation with C+, B+, N+ ions with dose D = 1017 ions/cm2 and energy of 40 keVwere taken for research. All samples were tested for wear resistance; microhardness was also measured and X-ray analysis was performed. Research results. It is shown that cast iron samples after ion implantation had higher wear resistance and microhardness in comparison with the initial state. The increase in hardness of all samples is apparently associated with the presence of a large number of specific radiation defects and the formation of dispersed phases (nitrides, borides, carbides). Discussion of the research results. The study of micro-hardness was carried out to determine the depth of the hardened layer after ion implantation with C+, B+, and N+ ions. The highest micro-hardness was detected at the surface of the sample after irradiation with N + ions. The lowest micro-hardness was obtained by B+ ions. X-ray analysis of cast iron samples after implantation by C+, B+, and N+ ions with dose D = 1017 ions/cm2 was carried out. It showed that during implantation Fe3C, FeB, Fe2B, Fe3N, and Fe2N phases are formed and changes in the fine structure are observed. Conclusion. Ion implantation of cast iron with C+, B+, N+ ions has shown that irradiation leads to: Increased wear resistance of the material; A significant increase in micro-hardness; Changes in the fine structure of the implanted cast iron (mosaic block size and average dislocation density) and the formation of carbides, borides, and nitrides. Resume. The results of the research show that ion implantation of cast iron can significantly increase the wear resistance of various units of machines (parts) and other mining equipment, which ultimately increases their service life. Suggestions for practical application and direction of future research. The shown results allow us to propose the method of ion implantation as a hardening treatment of parts made of cast iron used, in particular, in the mining industry. In order to develop ion implantation as one of the hardening technologies, it would be advisable to continue studying various physical and chemical properties (for example, corrosion resistance) after exposure to ion implantation. © 2023 North Caucasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, State Technological University.

In this case, the bend itself represents a rounded corner, the radius of which should not be less than the permissible value. During the bending process, the metal sheet on the bending line is deformed with tension on the outer surface and compression on the inner side of the corner. This changes the crystal lattice structure and can lead to its destruction in places of overstress. Such overstress due to strong bending of the sheet leads to its fracture along the fold line. Thus, for safe bending of sheet metal, it is necessary to select a value for the bending radius such that tension outside the corner and compression inside it do not lead to critical overstress, and the metal itself retains its strength on the bend. Compliance with the minimum radius when bending metal sheets leads to the need to take it into account when choosing the length of the sheet blank. The bending process is also influenced by the shape and design of the bending tool. The possibility of multi-point bending was studied using the example of a sheet product made of 08kp material under conditions of a shortage of bending tools. The features of multi-point bending of long products on modern equipment are shown and the process of ensuring the required accuracy of their parameters as a whole, including the corresponding stages of the product life cycle, is presented. Using mathematical modeling, a study was carried out on the bending of long products under conditions of a shortage of bending tools, and the data obtained were confirmed by practical work. © 2023 GORNYI ZHURNAL.

By deploying the IRS on drones, it becomes possible to improve the coverage and reliability of the communication network while reducing energy consumption and costs. Furthermore, integrating IRS with Federated Learning (FL) can further boost the performance of the drone network by enabling collaborative learning among multiple drones, leading to better and more efficient decision-making and holding great promise for enabling 6G communication networks. Therefore, we present a novel framework for FL meets IRS in drones for enabling 6G. In this framework, multiple IRS-equipped drone swarm are deployed to form a distributed wireless network, where FL techniques are used to collaborate with the learning process and optimize the reflection coefficients of each drone-IRS. This allows drone swarm to adapt to changing communication environments and improve the coverage and quality of wireless communication services. Integrating FL and IRS into drones offers several advantages over traditional wireless communication networks, including rapid deployment in emergencies or disasters, improved coverage and quality of communication services, and increased accessibility to remote areas. Finally, we highlight the challenges and opportunities of integrating FL and IRS into drones for researchers interested in drone networks. We also help drive innovation in developing 6G communication networks. © 2013 IEEE.","6G; drone swarm; drones; federated learning; IoT; IRS; smart environment","5G mobile communication systems; Array processing; Decision making; Drones; Energy utilization; Internet of things; Quality of service; Swarm intelligence; 6g; 6g mobile communication; Array signal processing; Communications networks; Drone swarm; Federated learning; Intelligent reflecting surface; IoT; Mobile communications; Particle swarm; Particle swarm optimization; Quality-of-service; Reflecting surface; Smart devices; Smart environment; Swarm optimization; Wireless communications; Particle swarm optimization (PSO)","","","","","","","Mozaffari M., Saad W., Bennis M., Nam Y.-H., Debbah M., A tutorial on UAVs for wireless networks: Applications, challenges, and open problems, IEEE Commun.

They are used in all areas of mechanical engineering, and production processes are constantly improving. The present study deals with the numerical modeling of dornless cold bending of a 30 mm diameter stainless steel pipe. The process parameters, such as bending radius, thinning coefficient and spring back angle, are computationally determined. Through finite element simulation, the directions of preferential thinning of the tube wall were established and defects, such as ovality of the crosssection, fracture and wrinkles, were identified. For the considered bending angle of 90° and at the bending radii, no material failures were found. However, there are areas with elevated values of principal stresses, which indicate significant tensile stresses. The deformation force varies in proportion to the wall thickness, which shows the major influence of the geometric factor and the minor influence of the technological indicator. The flattening factor depends on both the thinness factor and the bending radius. In order to avoid excessive reduction of the overall tube stiffness, this must be taken into consideration. When determining the springing, a significant discrepancy between the theoretical and calculated values was revealed, which shows the need to conduct experiments. Based on their results, reliability of the theoretical and numerical results can be determined, and their correction can be carried out. © 2023 GORNYI ZHURNAL.

To recovering their shape, the editing operation by compression is used at a pressure lower than the yield strength of the semi-finished product material. The process of editing a bimetallic billet with small curvature from layers differing in their physical properties is considered, at the next assumptions: we neglect of material hardening, the Bauschinger effect, friction of the semi-finished product on the stamp’s surface due to the smallness of plastic deformations during editing; we suppose, that the stress and deformation’s neutral layers at straightening of the curved billet coincide with each other and there are no initial residual stresses in the layers. As a result of the stress-strain state analysis, the mathematical dependencies were obtained that allow us to calculate the deformations and stresses in various layers of the semifinished product at compression by flat strikers, as well as were obtained the detail’s residual curvature after the operation and the necessary pressure forces, which are necessary to select the appropriate equipment. The analysis of picture changes in the stress distribution pattern in the process of increasing the tool pressure on the billet is performed, and the calculation features for finding the appearing deformation are mathematically presented. The character of changing in the bending moment from the applied compressive pressure between the flat strikers on the bimetallic billet at different initial bending radii is graphically presented. As an example, the process of editing the “tank cap” detail, used in the chemical industry and consisted from bimetal (of the layers of 45 and 65G steels), is considered. In this material, the thickness ratio of the soft and hard layers is 4:1, and the total thickness of bimetallic billet equals 20 mm. During the calculations, it was found that when creating a pressure close to the yield strength of the soft layer, the detail’s buckling decreases from 3.5 mm to 2.4 mm. © 2023 GORNYI ZHURNAL.

A characteristic feature of the North is negative ambient temperatures that have a negative impact on the condition of piston engines of ground transport, mobile and stationary power plants and labor saving tools. An engine is the least adapted unit for use in such conditions. There is a chain of negative factors that consistently links negative ambient temperatures, in which the equipment is operated, and the condition of the mechanisms and engine systems. The primary link of this chain is condensation processes. The existence of condensation processes during low-temperature operation of the engine has been experimentally proved. The latter takes place when warming up in conditions of negative ambient temperatures. The question «How much water changes the state during the warm-up period?» arises. AIMS: Development of a mathematical model that makes possible to obtain unbiased information about the activity of condensation processes and to estimate the amount of water that changes the state during the warm-up period. METHODS: Solving the given tasks is based on classical theories describing operational processes of boilers. The high labor intensity and significant financial costs in organizing such experiments require the search for new research methods. Mathematical models help to solve the task of defining the mass amount of water condensing in a cylinder of a piston engine computationally. RESULTS: The mathematical model that is characterized by its adaptation to piston engines and is capable of determining the mass amount of water changing the state during the warm-up period iteratively, using the differences in partial pressures and the density of the mass flow of water condensate, has been developed. CONCLUSIONS: The existence of water has a negative impact on conditions of a piston engine. The information about the amount of water condensing in a cylinder during the warm-up period stimulates to continue studies in the field of motor oils watering, active acids formation and corrosive wear of surfaces of details. © 2023, Eco-Vector LLC.

To substantiate and develop a program of physical and health promotion activities for students with different health levels. Materials and methods. The study involved 64 female students, ages 19–21, from the main medical group. In the experimental group, health promotion activities included health-enhancing aerobic exercises. The following research methods were used: literature review, pedagogical testing, anthropometrical measurements, functional tests and related indicators, pedagogical experiment, and mathematical statistics. Results. Two programs of health-enhancing aerobic exercises were developed with respect to the health levels and motor abilities of students. Our nine-month program included two 90-minute classes per week. The main feature of the program was the integration of two programs into a single training module, “Health-enhancing aerobic exercises”. The first program contributed to the improvement of morphological indicators in female students, including circumference measurements (waist by 8.2 %, shoulders by 9.2 %, hips by 6.3 %, buttocks by 5.3 %). After the first semester, 34.5 % of female students improved their physical fitness and entered a new functional group with more intense aerobic exercise. Conclusions. The study shows that our complex two-level system of health-enhancing aerobic exercises resulted in the development of various morphofunctional parameters. A significant increase was recorded for such parameters as flexibility (82 %), speed and strength (28 %), and dynamic strength (22 %). The proposed program allowed female students with different health levels to unite while differentiating their physical activities and individualizing the approach to each student. © 2023 South Ural State University - Institute of Sport, Tourism and Service.

Within this context, Healthcare 5.0 signifies a holistic approach to healthcare delivery, where interconnected technologies enable data-driven decision-making, patient-centric care, and enhanced efficiency. This paper provides an in-depth exploration of FL's role within the framework of Healthcare 5.0 and its implications for the pandemic response. Specifically, FL offers the potential to revolutionize pandemic preparedness within Healthcare 5.0 in several vital ways: it enables collaborative learning from distributed data sources without compromising individual data privacy, facilitates decentralized decision-making by empowering local healthcare institutions to contribute to a collective knowledge pool, and enhances real-time surveillance, enabling early detection of outbreaks and informed responses. We start by laying out the concepts of FL and Healthcare 5.0, followed by an analysis of current pandemic preparedness and response mechanisms. We delve into FL's applications and case studies in healthcare, highlighting its potential benefits, including privacy protection, decentralized decision-making, and implementation challenges. By articulating how FL fits into Healthcare 5.0, we envisage future applications in a technologically integrated health system. By examining current applications and case studies of FL in healthcare, we highlight its potential benefits, including enhanced privacy protection and more effective decision support systems. Our findings demonstrate that FL can significantly improve pandemic response times and accuracy. Moreover, we speculate on the potential scenarios where FL could enhance pandemic preparedness and make healthcare more resilient. Finally, we recommend that policymakers, technologists, and educators address potential challenges and maximize the benefits of FL in Healthcare 5.0. This paper aims to contribute to the discourse on next-generation healthcare technologies, emphasizing FL's potential to shape a more resilient healthcare future. © 2023 Saeed Hamood Alsamhi et al.","","","","","","","","","Wazid M., Das A.K., Mohd N., Park Y., Healthcare 5.0 security framework: applications, issues and future research directions, IEEE Access, (2022); Navarro V., The new conventional wisdom: an evaluation of the WHO report health systems: improving performance, International Journal of Health Services, 31, 1, pp. 23-33, (2001); Kruk M.E., Myers M., Varpilah S.T., Dahn B.T., What is a resilient health system?

Ibragimov Complex Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Grozny, Russian Federation","Quartz resources play a crucial role in the development of key economic sectors, particularly in the production of chemically pure silicon. The extraction and processing of these resources necessitate high-tech methods to obtain the desired silicon output. Presently, the demand for silicon stands at 5–6 Ktpa, while the supply remains at 2300 t. An analysis of the chemical properties of various rocks (quartzites, quartz sands, vein quartz) in the Republic of North Ossetia–Alania reveals that their parametric characteristics align with the requirements for silicon production. The researchers in North Ossetia have successfully grown single-crystal silicon and produced photovoltaic converters. Russian scientists have also achieved the first melting of metallurgical silicon into polycrystalline silicon using vacuum furnaces and electron-beam remelting, yielding promising results. The goal of this research is to analyze and assess the potential of high-quality quartz resources in the North Caucasus. The main objectives include identifying sites with optimal quartz deposits suitable for silicon production, conducting localization, estimating forecast resources, and designating areas for further investigation. The selected sites are expected to possess advantageous geographical and economic features, along with favorable mining conditions conducive to open-pit mining. The study focuses on the Fiagdon site in the Alagir District, RNO-Alania. Various methods, including laboratory work, sampling, examination of constructed sections, and a comprehensive review of mine workings and borehole documentation, were employed. Conclusions from mineralogical and petrographic analyses, alongside laboratory studies and process tests, contributed to the research methodology. The results of the research encompassed the analysis of statistical, economic, geological, and process-related information necessary for addressing primary geological objectives. Subsequent steps involved the selection of prospects for further exploration, specification of geological maps at a 1:10000 scale with accompanying legends and sections, determination of the conditions, morphology, and parameters of productive deposits, and preliminary studies on the quality and process characteristics of quartz resources. Furthermore, the P2 forecast resources of high-quality quartz raw materials for silicon production were localized, estimated at 500 Kt, and rigorously tested.

Methods and structure of the study. Schoolchildren from the 2nd grade of the general education school No. 60, Kirov, participated in the pedagogical experiment. The ability to rhythm of movements was determined using the ""Running in rhythm"" test. Statistical processing used Student's T-test. Results and conclusions. After the end of the pedagogical experiment, the indicators of children in the control group improved by 2.8% (p>0.05). The performance of children in the experimental group improved by 24.7% (p<0.05). Such results can be explained by the effectiveness of performing a set of exercises using standard classics in physical education classes at school. Indicators of feeling the rhythm of movements will improve significantly if children aged 8-9 years additionally perform a set of physical exercises of standard classics at physical education lessons at school. © 2023, Teoriya i praktika fizicheskoy kul'tury i sporta.

The problem of using substandard raw materials for traditional methods of enrichment is associated with the problem of strengthening the mineral resource base of metallurgy. Among the directions of extraction of metals from ores, the priority of the problem of waste-free production or the inclusion of waste products from the tailings of primary processing into use without restrictions on sanitary conditions is noted. The article substantiates the feasibility of implementing a new direction for the mining industry: involvement in the production of substandard metal-containing raw materials of technogenic origin by leaching in a high-speed disintegrator mill. The results of the state of the mineral resource base of non–ferrous metals are given. New data on the extraction and loss of metals in the process of ore dressing are presented. A decrease in the gap between the content in processing waste and in ore reserves was noted. It is shown that the total value of metals in waste is comparable to the value of potential mineral resources in the subsurface. The expediency of assessing the possibilities of technologies for the utilization of man-made reserves by modeling the processing indicators is substantiated. It is concluded that the problems of using mining waste should be solved in a single package by creating a technological cycle of extraction and processing of man-made waste, the use of which can make the development of technogenic deposits economically profitable. The purpose of research on the prospects of solving the problem concerned is to prove the possibility of extracting metals from man-made raw materials to the desired level which is achieved by using the method of mathematical modeling of metal leaching processes. © 2023, Ore and Metals Publishing house.

It has been experimentally established that the magnitude and distribution of contact stresses across the width of the strip are affected by the magnitude and nature of the distribution of longitudinal stresses in the outer parts of the roll. An increase in tensile stresses in the outer parts of the strip leads to a decrease in the normal contact stresses and the average pressure of the metal on the rolls, and vice versa. An equation is proposed for calculating the coefficient of influence of uneven longitudinal stresses on the pressure of the metal on the rolls. Using CAD, computer modeling and calculation of the deformation and force indicators of thin strip rolling were carried out, taking into account the influence of the characteristics of the outer parts of the rolled product on the deformation zone. Changes in the rolling forces along the length of thin strips of 08kp steel on a 150×235 mill equipped with a microcontroller system for measuring the loads on the rolls are shown. Measurements showed that the rolling force during deformation of the end sections of the strips is 2–3 times less than the middle part of the rolled product, due to the weak influence of the outer parts of the strip on the pressure and rolling force. A quantitative analysis of changes in the size of strips and rolling forces in stationary and unsteady sections along the length of the strip has been carried out. The equation for determining the average pressure of the metal on the rolls has been refined, taking into account the influence of the external parts and the rigidity of the strip on the deformation zone during thin-sheet rolling. It is shown that the proposed equations can significantly improve the accuracy of pressure calculation and determination of rolling forces along the length of thin strips and strips. Taking into account the influence of the characteristics of the outer ""hard"" parts of the strip makes it possible to reduce the error in determining the average pressure, on average from 23.8 to 4.9%. © 2023, Ore and Metals Publishing house.

Quantitative indicators are presented concerning the pollution of residential areas with natural leaching products. It is proposed to extract toxic metals from the liquid leaching products as they reach the earth surface. The mechanism of environmental degradation as a result of the activities of the enterprises of the Sadon lead-zinc plant is detailed. It is shown that the phenomenon of extraction of metals from natural and technological solutions can be used in the implementation of environmental protection processes. The results of the application of geotechnological methods of metal production in the North Caucasus are summarized. The contribution of scientists from the North Caucasus Mining and Metallurgical Institute to the theory and practice of metal leaching is noted. The program of technological and medical research was developed, and the results of comprehensive studies of the morbidity of mine workers and residents of residential areas depending on the distance from the source of pollution are presented. An algorithm for the organization of preventive leaching of ores left in the worked-out space is proposed. It is proved that the chemical impact of natural leaching of ore mining and processing products on the population of residential areas is the cause of technogenic metal-induced toxicity and is accompanied by an increase in diseases. It is substantiated that a radical measure to prevent progressive morbidity is the preventive extraction of metals from ore processing tailings and mine wastewater.

On the example of deposits of the Sadon ore cluster, the hazard of metallized mine effluents for living matter and humans is shown. Of the relatively young methods of mine water purification, the most promising is the combination of electrochemical softening of mine effluents with electrodialysis desalination and concentration. The improvement of environmental protection technologies is developing on the basis of the managed disposal of mining and processing waste as a generator of natural leaching. The results are presented related to the experimental study of the parameters of metals extraction from the mine effluents by electrodialysis desalination with simultaneous concentration. The mechanism is formulated related to the development of oxidative processes of sulfide minerals in the presence of carbon dioxide of the mine atmosphere with the occurrence of electrochemical bonds between the crystals and mineral grains. The process of electromembrane treatment of metal-containing wastes is detailed. It is shown that during the electrochemical decomposition of salt systems, associated commercial products are formed. The dynamics of pollution of the Ardon river washing the Sadon deposit is given. The chemical processes of leaching of lost ores are described. An installation for electrochemical wastewater treatment is recommended, and a quantitative assessment of its efficiency is given. It is noted that the processes of electrochemical wastewater treatment are adequate, described by linear graphs and subject to correction. It is shown that the drains of mines are hazardous for living matter. It is indicated that the improvement of environmental protection technologies will be developed in the direction of waste disposal of mining and processing. The general principle of mine water hazard reduction is a combination of electrochemical softening with electrodialysis desalination and concentration. © 2023, STC Industrial Safety CJSC.

Graphs of the dependence of the deformation value on the stress value for steel 20 GOST 1050-2013 are constructed, thereby making it possible to predict the properties of parts obtained by cold forging. In order to construct the dependence of the strain intensity and stress intensity and to plot the hardening graph, experiments were carried out on compressing samples from the researched metal. Due to good lubrication at the ends of the sample (periodically replaced gaskets made of polyethylene film in combination with engine oil), the stress state can be considered linear. The stress state index K = 0,33, the Lode-Nadai indicator μσ = 1. To reduce the barrel shape during upsetting, the height of the samples and the diameter of the initial dimensions are within the limits 2 ≥ H0/D0 ≥ 1. Steel 20 GOST 1050-2013 was selected for the study. Hot-rolled round steel rolled according to GOST 2590-88 was used as blanks. To determine stresses at different degrees of deformation, it is possible to use an approximate mathematical expression, since the use of a graph is not always convenient and does not provide high accuracy. To obtain a mathematical expression, an approximation of the hardening curve was carried out in the Excel program. Excel has a polynomial function with a confidence value of 0.9931, for use in modeling in the QForm software package. © 2023, Ore and Metals Publishing house.

Crystals were grown by directed crystallization of the melt in a cold crucible. Crystals were studied by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, impedance spectroscopy, and indentation. The concentration dependences of the investigated characteristics of crystals are obtained. It has been shown that an increase in the concentration of the stabilizing oxide in all cases leads to a decrease in the amount of the transformed t-phase and reduces the value of the crack resistance of the crystals. In this case, a decrease in the size of the twins and an increase in the defectiveness of the structure are observed, which is accompanied by a slight decrease in the electrical conductivity of tetragonal solid solutions. The influence of the ionic radius of trivalent cations on the stabilization of tetragonal phases, conductivity, and the mechanical properties of crystals is discussed. An increase in the values of crack resistance and a decrease in the values of high-temperature electrical conductivity of tetragonal solid solutions in the series Y2O3 → Gd2O3 → Sm2O3 at comparable concentrations of stabilizing oxides were established. It has been shown that ZrO2 solid solutions stabilized with Sm2O3 can be used as functional supporting membranes in solid oxide fuel cells. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Conductivity;

For colloidal synthesis of the objects under study, cadmium acetate dihydrate Cd(CH3COO)2·2H2O and trioctylphosphine selenide were used as precursors of cadmium and selenium, respectively, and solutions of oleic acid and octadecene were also used. Luminescence spectrum of cadmium selenide nanoscrolls was recorded using a fiber charge coupled device spectrometer. Spectrally resolved photoluminescence decays for nanoparticles were measured with the use of time-correlated single photon counting technique. The emission of the cadmium selenide nanoscrolls consists of interband and recombination luminescence bands. We found that the normalized photon numbers of recombination luminescence are larger than the normalized photon numbers of interband luminescence. We determined dominant wavelengths, chromaticity coordinates, and correlated color temperatures of ultrathin colloidal semiconductor cadmium selenide nanoscrolls. These ultrathin cadmium selenide nanoscrolls are promising for application in light-emitting diodes. © 2023 Russian Journal of Infection and Immunity.

The microstructure of the studied as-cast alloys consists of an aluminium solid solution and a dispersion eutectic comprising phases of non-equilibrium origin. No primary phases of crystallization origin were found in the structure when the Fe concentration did not exceed 0.5 wt. %. Iron-bearing phases are included in the multiphase eutectic, and the presence of calcium in these phases is below the expected level, which suggests that the share of the ternary compound Al10CaFe2 in the content is really small. An increase in the Fe concentration to 1% contributes to the formation of fan-shaped crystals corresponding to the Al3Fe phase, which are, though, of small size (20 μm maximum). Because of its high solubility in the Al4Ca phase, zinc weakens the aluminium solid solution while failing to prevent the formation of the strengthening Tphase (Al2Mg3Zn3) present in the calculations. The concentration of magnesium in (Al) is lower than its concentration in the alloys. Cooling down of alloys together with the furnace helped determine how the rate of crystallization can influence the phase composition. Conglomerates of (AlZn)3Mg2 and (AlZn)2(MgCa) phases were identified in all the alloys. The following peritectic reaction was observed in almost none of the alloys: L + Al3Fe (Al) + Al10CaFe2. As the result of this, Al3Fe phase needles appeared in the structure. Fan-shaped iron-bearing crystals of mixed composition were only observed in the 0.25% Fe alloy.

Underground mining of rock massifs of powerful deposits on deep horizons is accompanied by geomechanical phenomena, which are prevented by the construction of artificial structures made of solid mixtures in the developed space. Controlling geomechanics of the massif increases the completeness of subsoil use and is an actual direction of mining production. Objective: detailing the array state management technology by rationally regulating the voltages in the array. Object: arrays of deposits of the Talnakh ore node. Methods: modeling and experiment, the results of which are the basis for the development of a model and recommendations. Results. The paper introduces the assessment of the behavior of natural and artificial massifs differentially for the main deposits of the ore node. The regularities of combining options for unloading arrays from critical stresses are established: with overworking and with a protective layer underworking. The principles of optimization of ore mining technology taking into account the geomechanical features of the arrays are summarized. Measures to increase the volumetric compression of filling mixtures for variants of chamber systems of development are recommended. The results of modeling the influence of the volumes of rock inclusions on the efficiency of field development are presented. A model of ecological and economic assessment of technologies is proposed, taking into account the costs of creating protective layers and reducing the dilution of ores. Unloading of arrays from stresses provides an opportunity to regulate the stress level with a decrease in deformations, including during selective excavation of ores with the abandonment of rock layers in the bowels. Conclusions. Unloading arrays from operating stresses is an effective measure to solve the main problems of subsurface use at the same time. The implementation of this direction in the conditions of localization of the Talnakh ore deposits can be carried out by advanced excavation of the soil layer. The efficiency of working out stress-deformed arrays is achieved by the rational interaction of natural and technological factors of development. © 2023 Tomsk Polytechnic University, Publishing House.

Ratio-nalization of the methods for controlling the state of an ore-bearing massif, considering their geomechanics, is becoming a priority direction for improving technologies for the development of complex structure ore deposits. The purpose of the study is to substantiate the possibility of managing the state of massifs based on the combination of filling mixtures in the conditions of the Sadon ore belt deposit. The complex of studies includes the engineering division of the massif with the allocation of engineering structural sections. By modeling on equivalent materials, a mechanism for the development of stresses in the vicinity of a working was established. It is determined that the studied massif is discrete with a gravitational-tectonic-structural stress field. Based on the experimental data, a model of the intensity of the ore-bearing massif is built on the basis of the hypothesis of wedging of the rocks of the bearing layer. The role of expansion stresses and backfill strength in the input of the massif into the volumetric compression mode is determined. A stress control technique is proposed by dividing the massif into geomechanically safe areas. It was proven that backfilling systems ensure the recovery of reserves, improve the quality of ores and preserve the earth surface, protecting the region from the negative impact of mining. The complexity of exploitation of ore-bearing massifs determines the need to monitor the geomechanics of ore-bearing rocks. The combination of technologies is a real step in improving mining production, as it allows to reduce ore dilution, increase labor productivity, and also improve the safety conditions of workers by increasing the reliability of technology parameters. © 2023, STC Industrial Safety CJSC.

The results of studying the properties of nanocomposites, method for the synthesis of metal-carbon nanocomposites by pyrolysis using infrared heating are reviewed. The magnetic, electromagnetic, and radar-absorbing properties of the obtained nanocomposites depending on the synthesis temperature and metal concentration were studied. It is shown that the chosen metals, alloys (FeCo) and carbon material are effective for isolating magnetic nanoparticles when developing hybrid radar-absorbing composites. Moreover, methods for controlling the radar-absorbing properties of hybrid composites and the prospects for improving the impedance matching are considered. An analysis of the efficiency of absorption of electromagnetic radiation by FeCo/C nanocomposites synthesized by different methods is presented. The possibility of controlling the morphology and properties of metal-carbon nanocomposites using certain approaches to synthesis, varying the compositions of precursors, and the orientation of FeCo nanoparticles synthesized in the form of flakes in the composite has been revealed. The results of the study can be used to improve the technique of using FeCo/C nanocomposites obtained by pyrolysis of organometallic precursors based on polyacrylonitrile in the field of radar-absorbing materials. © 2023 TEST-ZL Publishing, LLC.","carbon matrix; FeCo nanoparticles; FeCo/C nanocomposites; impedance matching; loss tangent; polyacrylonitrile; reflection loss; saturation magnetization","","","","","","","","Sun X., Не J., Li G., Et al., Laminated magnetic graphene with enhanced electromagnetic wave absorption properties, Mater.

These issues are directly related to the modernization of the mining and processing industries. The environmental responsibility of mining enterprises is becoming a central issue when developing development strategies for many Russian and foreign companies. An analysis of data on the ecology of production and greenhouse gas emissions during mining is presented. Methodological difficulties in measuring carbon footprints have been identified, which include both direct emissions at the enterprise and indirect emissions associated with the production of electricity, heat, as well as raw materials and components. We have identified 3 groups of enterprises in the mining industry that are taking different approaches to decarbonization. A comparative analysis of Russian and foreign companies on greenhouse gas emissions, energy and water consumption, and waste generation was carried out. The carbon footprint analysis allowed us to assess the impact of various factors and strategies on greenhouse gas emissions in the mining industry. The research took into account regional and global features of the influence of carbon emissions, technical and economic indicators of mining enterprises. © 2023 Publishing house Mining book.

Zabelin as an archaeologist is evaluated ambiguously in the history of the discipline. The previously unknown record, I.E. Zabelin’s handwritten manual on the excavation of the barrow mounds in the North Pontic Area, provides some new insights on his field research approaches. I.E. Zabelin recommended to take apart the mounds completely, from the top to the bottom, and it was only the modest funding and the lack of time which forced him to dig isolated trenches. I.E. Zabelin insisted that the finds were left in situ and gave some seminal advices on how the chief grave must be found and recovered. The archaeologist demanded to use a compass as well as to be sure to draw a plan and sections of the barrow and mark the location of the finds in the mound. The manual requested that the field journal was necessarily kept to make entries about all the details ever observed, with the descriptions of all the skeletons of humans and horses and the grave goods precisely registered. I.E. Zabelin drawn up his manual while generalizing his own experience of excavating mounds of Scythia and necropoleis of the ancient Greek cities, and he himself followed all the rules he had proposed, as it is evidenced by various archival and published materials. I.E. Zabelin was an attentive and responsible field researcher. Subsequently, it is advisable to use archival materials to analyze I.E. Zabelin’s contribution to archaeological theory and method. © 2023, Cimmeria Publishing.

It is noted that the technological capabilities of the machine are not limited to this type of testing, but can be used to perform various types of investigation of the sheet materials’ properties. Such possibilities are due to the fact that, according to the principle of operation, the machine is a double-acting press, and the experimental equipment installed on the machine can perform clamping and plastic deformation of sheet metal. This paper considers the possibilities of using the machine to conduct various types of tests that differ from the Eriksen method (a test for biaxial tension with preservation of flatness in the test area, a test for torsion of a sheet specimen in its plane, etc.). The experience of using the machine for experimental investigations of the behavior of sheet materials in various sheet stamping operations, such as forming, drawing and stretching, is presented. The possible region of application of the machine for testing and debugging the production technologies for stamping, the basis of which is the operation of extraction, is indicated. The machine’s capabilities provide testing to evaluate and refine the plastic properties of sheet metals. With the use of special test equipment, experimental data can be obtained to construct a diagram of extreme deformations, which is the most important characteristic used to predict the destruction of a stamped sheet blank. This characteristic determines the ratio of deformations occurring in the sheet, at which destruction occurs. This knowledge is especially important for new types of deformable sheet steels of increased strength, mastered by the metallurgical industry. © 2023, Ore and Metals Publishing house.

Nanoparticles layers based on metal chalcogenides (MoS2, WS2, ZnS) and titanium were applied onto substrate by spray deposition method. Nanoparticles and flakes were synthesized by laser ablation and fragmentation in liquid by femtosecond pulses. We investigated the size and morphology of the synthesized nanoparticles: WS2-based flakes have a polygonal shape with dimensions up to 600 nm, other types of nanoparticles have a shape closer to spherical with sizes from 50 to 150 nm. Interaction of ultrafast laser radiation with materials in liquid is accompanied by the dissociation of water molecules leads to formation of hydrogen sulfide and oxides. To assess the biocompatibility of layers with synthesized nanoparticles, the MTT assay was performed with fibroblast cells. According to in vitro studies, Ti-based nanoparticles have the largest biocompatibility, and WS2-based flakes have the smallest ones. Thus, synthesized Ti-based nanoparticles can be used in biomedical applications to support tissue regeneration without additional modification. Due to their properties, metal sulfides-based nanoparticles can be used in the photodynamic therapy of oncological diseases to destroy cancer cells. © 2023 Journal of Biomedical Photonics & Engineering.","biological markers; metal chalcogenides; nanoparticles; pulsed laser ablation in liquid; pulsed laser fragmentation; targeted drug delivery; theranostics; toxicity","","","","","","Russian Science Foundation, RSF, (22-79-10348)","This study was funded by the Russian Science Foundation (project no. 22-79-10348, https://rscf.ru/project/22-79-10348/).","Canaparo R., Foglietta F., Limongi T., Serpe L., Biomedical Applications of Reactive Oxygen Species Generation by Metal Nanoparticles, Materials (Basel), 14, 1, (2020); Nguyen K.

Multistage hydraulic fracturing (MHF) is proposed for the offshore Challenger Sea field (Southeast Dome). The implementation of this technique at a shelf will be a source of additional risks. For example, the properties of the RR-2 overlying seal have not been unambiguously assessed, and there are a number of geological uncertainties, such as the tectonic regime. However, there are a number of arguments in favor of MHF: heterogeneity of the reservoir; low permeability; low water cut of the field; sufficient thickness of the pay zone; and the overlying seal. One more positive factor is that sand ingress is not observed in the process of oil production. The selection of a principal well completion scheme on the eastern side of the RR-7 formation is aimed at effectively recovering the remaining reserves. The objectives of the study performed are: to create a geological and hydrodynamic model of the Challenger Sea (Southeast Dome); develop 1D and 3D geomechanical models; evaluate oil production forecasts based on fundamentally different well completion schemes; and determine the optimum parameters for multistage hydraulic fracturing. The research methods included: petrophysical methods; logging methods; core studies; drilling reports and formation testing data; and 3D, 4D geomechanical simulation. Other geophysical methods included acoustic logging, density logging, and gamma-ray logging. After building a geomechanical model of the reservoir at the beginning of drilling, a hydrodynamic calculation was performed. This established the reservoir pressures and saturations at certain points in time. The results made it possible for the principal stress directions, the values of effective and principal stresses, and the values of elastic strains to be determined. In order to assess MGF process efficiency, production forecasts were made using a hydrodynamic model for an exploration well with conventional completion (perforated liner) and with five-stage MGF. In the first case, the accumulated production was 144 kt over 15 years, and in the second case, 125 kt over 17 years. The difference in cumulative production is due to different initial well flow rates, as well as the rate of oil withdrawal during the first few years of development. Thereafter, the production and daily flow rate curves showed similar behavior. In order to select the most effective option, an economic analysis of the efficiency was performed. © 2023, National University of Science and Technology MISIS.

In order to study vehicle dynamics, stability and handling, as well as to accelerate and to reduce the cost of on-board software development, it is necessary to build a digital twin which contains description of special motion of a vehicle with models of units and subsystems as parts of the vehicle. AIMS: Development and verification of a virtual prototype of a vehicle. METHODS: Development of the virtual prototype and vehicle modelling were done in the MATLAB/Simulink software package. Main derivation of the equations necessary to build the models of vehicle’s units and subsystems is given. Verification testing was conducted using special measuring equipment. RESULTS: The vehicle virtual prototype containing description of combined dynamics of bodyframe, transmission elements, suspension and wheels was developed. Comparison of results of field and virtual testing was made in order to confirm operability and adequacy of the virtual prototype. Main graphs showing dynamics of real and virtual vehicles are presented. CONCLUSIONS: Practical value of development and study lies in ability of using a virtual prototype in vehicle dynamic studies and development of on-board control systems. © 2023, Eco-Vector LLC.

To determine the presence of musculoskeletal disorders in young weightlifters. Materials and methods. The sample consisted of 60 young athletes, including the main group of 40 athletes with musculoskeletal disorders. Physical examination showed postural instability; goniometry allowed for the assessment of spinal mobility; and plantography provided data on the presence of flat feet. Results. The comprehensive examination of the musculoskeletal system in young weightlifters showed different postural disorders, spine-related movement restrictions, and flat feet. The greatest restrictions were associated with painful rotation and extension movements. The results obtained provided data on the direct interaction between the anatomical and nervous structures of the spine and contributed to the diagnosis of vertebrogenic disorders in young athletes. Conclusions. The results of the study showed that young weightlifters with spinal disorders had local spine-related movement restrictions associated with pain syndrome, of which 35% of cases were combined with flat feet. Based on the data obtained, the measures of physical rehabilitation and ways to improve the educational and training processes were determined. © 2023 South Ural State University - Institute of Sport, Tourism and Service.

Modeling of the process allowed us to establish that when rolling along the length of the workpiece and a solid piercing mandrel made of 4X5MFS steel, an unevenness of temperature is formed, which is associated with heat transfer during the formation of the cavity. It is shown that the temperature unevenness along the length of the vessel is 200 °C, and the stitching mandrel is 250 °C. At the same time, the bottom part of the vessel and the toe of the mandrel are more heated to 1140 °C and 600 °C compared to the upper part of the vessel and the base of the mandrel 940 and 350 °C, respectively. A hundred-fold simulation of the firmware process allowed us to establish the influence of the heating temperature of the mandrel on its wear of about 0.64 and 2.4 mm from tangential and normal stresses of about, respectively, which does not allow for the specified geometric dimensions of semi-finished products. Modeling has established that the temperature unevenness after rolling persists after stamping and ranges from 950 to 750 °C, the temperature difference is the same 200 °C, which affects the conditions of subsequent cooling when simulating quenching in mineral oil. At the same time, an unevenness of indicators along the length of semi-finished products is formed: hardness from 460 to 740 HV and strength from 1050 to 1700 MPa. The recommendations of repeated heat treatment are given, allowing to align the mechanical properties of rolled products along the length: hardness 500 HV, tensile strength 1000 MPa. The design of a water-cooled mandrel has been developed and tested on a screw mill 30–80, the use of which makes it possible to reduce the temperature of the nose to 400 °C at the base to 150 °C, which positively affects its service life, which increases up to 2.7 times. At the same time, dimensions are formed that meet the requirements of the design documentation for the cavity of the vessel made of steel 50 presented by the BF JSC NPO Pribor. An adequate regression equation is constructed that establishes a linear dependence of the change in the diameter of the cavity on the number of vessels released. © 2023, Ore and Metals Publishing house.

Modeling is carried out by the finite element method using a material model developed on the basis of the results of testing samples for compression and tension at temperatures of 1050, 1100 and 1150 °C and different strain rates. The material model is based on the theory of plastic flow with combined hardening. The developed model makes it possible to take into account the features of material deformation that occur during its cyclic loading at a variable speed, including the change in material parameters during the transition from one speed to another. The model is generalized to the case of non-isothermal loading. A method for identifying the parameters of the model is based on the results of the tests carried out and the obtained material functions are provided. The problem of the rolling process modeling is solved in a three-dimensional setting. To carry out the simulation, the developed model was introduced into the SimuliaAbaqus software package using a user subroutine. Based on the results of the calculation, cartograms of residual stresses, maximum values of plastic deformation, and values of displacements in the axial and radial directions at the end of the rolling process were obtained. The dependence of the change in plastic deformation in the process of rolling in the axial and radial directions is obtained, on the basis of which conclusions are drawn about the features of the deformation of the material in the process of rolling. The reliability of the results of mathematical modeling, the developed deformation model and the method for determining the material functions was confirmed by comparing the disk shape obtained as a result of the calculation with the disk shape obtained during the rolling process. © 2023 Lobachevsky State University of Nizhny Novgorod.

The experience of their operation at agricultural enterprises shows that current power distribution systems in drivetrains does not consider the full range of factors affecting the motion of vehicles, which decreases the efficiency of their use. AIMS: Development of the method of synthesis of patterns of power distribution between the driving wheels of all-wheel drive agricultural trucks. METHODS: Based on methods of system analysis, multiobjective optimization, regression and correlation analyses, the step-by-step method of synthesis of basic patterns of power distribution between the driving wheels of an all-wheel drive car and their adaptation to real driving conditions is proposed. Fundamentals of the study are basic patterns of power distribution, adopted to operation conditions of a all-wheel drive truck. RESULTS: The method of synthesis of power distribution patterns is considered step-by-step, based on multiobjective optimization. The design and operational factors that set the parameters of traffic on roads of all types and terrain have been established. The basic patterns of power distribution that ensure the effi-ciency, reliability and safety of a vehicle are revealed. Depending on the functions, all-wheel drive trucks are conditionally divided into 4 groups with their own indicators and performance criteria. Based on the conducted study, 4 optimization problems are formulated. CONCLUSIONS: The authors have developed the method for determining the patterns of power distribution between the driving wheels of all-wheel drive trucks and their adaptation to traffic conditions. The main stages of the method are: formulation of the optimization problem; computational procedure and determination of basic patterns of power distribution; adaptation of the basic patterns and evaluation of effectiveness of solutions. It is found that it is sufficient to use the differential equations of straight-line motion when simulating the motion of all-wheel drive trucks along the route. © 2023, Eco-Vector LLC.

The experience of involving non-conditioned metal-containing raw materials in operation is summarized. The task of developing the scientific foundations of the processes of transferring metals to a mobile state and extracting metals from a solution with environmental safety is formulated. It is shown that metal extraction technologies using the phenomenon of metal transfer to a mobile state are being industrially developed as an opportunity to reduce metal losses at the stages of extraction and processing. The practice of leaching substandard ores from deposits in the North Caucasus, Central Asia, Kazakhstan and Russia is summarized. Detailed information is provided on the development of a number of deposits by variants with ore preparation by boreholes, storage and infiltration of reagents. The data on the results of laboratory studies of the leaching of ores of ferruginous quartzites of Les-Bedinsky in the disintegrator and uranium ores of the Vostok and Zvezdnoye deposits (Kazakhstan) are presented. It is shown that in the fields of Transbaikalia leaching provides most of the annual production with the extraction of 85%. The base of extraction is systematized — reserves of technogenic deposits of Russia. The tasks of implementing the concept of metal leaching are set: selectivization of metal extraction from solution, neutralization of masterbatch solutions, etc. An algorithm for solving problems of improving metal extraction using hydrometallurgical processing processes is recommended. The calculation of quantitative parameters of extraction of metals from ore enrichment sites and the effect of tailings activation in the disintegrator on the homogeneity of the mixture in the conditions of a particular enterprise is given. The scientific novelty of the obtained results consists in the use of new activation tools developed with the personal participation of the author, as well as the combination of technologies based on the completeness of the use of natural resources. The results of the study can be used in the development of technologies for leaching metals from substandard in terms of metal content of raw materials. In comparison with related publications on the subject and intended purpose, the proposed article contains information about the practice of transferring metals to a mobile state, as an opportunity to reduce metal losses in the process of mining, including underground. © 2023 Publishing house Mining book.

The major identified influences on the rock cutting efficiency are the jointing and porosity of rocks, described in terms of the structural weakening coefficient (λ), permeability (k), their ratio (k/λ) and the mining depth (Н). The slot cutting velocity patterns subject to the mining depth and the structural weakening coefficient are obtained for the specific types of rocks, and the conformable graphs are constructed. Porosity exerts rather tangible effect on the velocity of hydraulic cutting in rocks. © 2023 Publishing house Mining book.

We present a hardware and software system for diagnosing degradation processes in sensors operating in long-term stationary pulse modes or in conditions of electrothermal overloads. Examples of test structures on which degradation processes were recorded in thermal shock mode are provided. Bending vibrations of 0.1–3 kHz occur in the wafer during a surface thermal shock. Test structures were used as heat sources, through which single square current pulses with an amplitude of (1–8)·1010 A/m2 and a duration of 50–500 µs were passed. A correlation between the energy of bending vibrations and presence of degradation processes on the semiconductor surface was established. Irreversible degradation processes cause a sharp increase in vibrational energy. The results can be used in the development of methods for diagnosing the thermal behavior of semiconductor structures. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Defects; Electrical faults; Explosion; Fault isolation; Mechanical and thermal shock; Shock waves; Thin-film","Semiconductor devices; Shock waves; Silicon wafers; Thermal shock; Vibrations (mechanical); Bending vibrations; Degradation process; Electrical faults; Fault isolation; Mechanical; Mechanical and thermal shock; Shock-waves; Test-structure; Thermal behaviours; Thin-films; Thin films","","","","","Russian Science Foundation, RSF, (22–29-01373)","The study was supported by the Russian Science Foundation (Grant No. 22–29-01373).

S. Pushkin) and Prince Myshkin (“The Idiot” by F. M. Dostoevsky). The novelty of the research lies in the au-thors’ attempt to move from an empirical level of understanding the problem to a theoretical one. The methodological basis of the study becomes a semiotic approach to the analysis of literary texts. It is noted that it is the principles of semiotics that make it possible to put the accumulated baggage of empirical knowledge at the basis of a concept that points to the reasons for the double encoding of the characters’ images. The purpose of the article is to explain why Mozart and Prince Myshkin realize the image of the ideal person not in the sphere of functioning of the sacred code of culture, but in the sphere of profane culture, where each sacred image corresponds to a symbol related to sacred reality and transforming it. The comparison of the characters of Mozart and Prince Myshkin is based on the commonality of sacred motifs, supplemented by autobiographical, literary, and mythopoetic material. It is argued that these additions indicate the interaction in the consciousness of the writers in creating these images of the sacred, or biblical, code of culture with the profane. It is concluded that Mozart and Prince Myshkin are images created on the basis of double encoding and implying double interpretation. © 2023, Tsentr Nauchnykh i Obrazovatelnykh Proektov.

The paper considers a method for calculating the parameters of a roller crusher developed on the basis of established analytical dependencies: the theoretical and technical productivity of spalt sieves from the share of the total volume of rock mass, as well as the productivity of a roller crusher when overlapping spalt sieves with metal sheets. Purpose of the work: development of a methodology for calculating the parameters of a roller crusher. Methods and Materials. To achieve the goal of developing a methodology for calculating the parameters of a roller crusher, a search and analysis of materials on this topic was carried out. Research. The resulting method of calculating roller crushers allows you to evaluate the proposed equipment and, if necessary, select a control scheme for its main technical characteristics. Discussion. In the calculation method of a roller crusher, first of all, it is necessary to determine its main parameters, namely its technical performance, to identify the compliance of the obtained parameters with the requirements of further technological links. After determining the main parameters of the crusher, the design is adjusted and its parameters are adjusted, the technical characteristics of roller crushers have high values and various variants of the overlap schemes of the trellis sieves and the roll of the crusher are recommended to reduce the productivity of roller crushers. Conclusion. Studies have shown that the proposed method is suitable for calculating the technical characteristics of roller crushers. © 2023 North Caucasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, State Technological University.

A comparative study was conducted to compare the ball mill and disintegrator in terms of performance for obtaining mechanically activated powders from lithium-cobalt batteries. Parameters of ground and mechanically activated powders were determined, such as particle size distribution, mean equivalent diameter and specific surface of particles.

In this regard, it is necessary to accurately predict the change in this parameter during the drawing process. The proposed calculation method, which involves introducing the coefficient into the solution of the strain rate components equations, shows the proportion of the strain rate that is taken over by the change in thickness. A method is shown for determining the transition boundary between the zone of thinning and increasing thickness on the flange of an axisymmetric workpiece. The changes in the transition boundary from thinning to thickening are shown in the form of graphs depending on the ratio of the diameter of the workpiece to the diameter of the retracted layer. It has been shown that the force conditions of the process can be greatly influenced by blank holder. It has been established that the hold-down pressure has a minimal effect on the process power if the diameter of the workpiece approaches the die orifice diameter. As the diameter of the workpiece increases, the influence of the hold-down pressure becomes significant, which leads to a decrease in power values. Changes in the thickness of the sheet material flange made of steel 08ps with a thickness of 0.5 and 1 mm are considered. It has been experimentally established that with the same amount of material drawn into the die orifice, the increase in flange thickness is greater for a workpiece of smaller diameter. It was found that the relative change in flange thickness is affected by the thickness of the material. In addition, it is necessary to take into account the dependence of the properties of the sheet material on its thickness, which is a consequence of the technological features of producing these sheets by rolling. © 2023, Ore and Metals Publishing house.

The study aims to propose a system of indicators for sustainable development. Within the framework of this thematic qualitative research, the main methods included the analysis of documents and sources selected according to special parameters. Based on the study results, it was concluded that to develop a system of environmental indicators for sustainable development, the theory of biotic regulation should be taken as a basis for determining priorities in ecology. According to this theory, biota is the main factor in ecology and the main mechanism for ensuring environmental sustainability. Its preservation will help maintain environmental standards at the proper level and ensure environmental safety for future generations. The study allows creating a system of sustainable development indicators, within which it is proposed to divide sustainable development indicators into three main groups: indicators of social factors of sustainable development, economic factors of sustainable development, and environmental factors of sustainable development. © 2023, Centro Universitario Curitiba - UNICURITIBA.

Aim of the article is to detail the dependence of the massif state on anthropogenic stresses during the development of ore deposits by underground method. Methods. Compliance of technologies for the development of mineral deposits with the principles of nature management is ensured by studying the dynamics of changes in the parameters of ore-containing massifs. Infrastructure facilities of mining enterprises and the Earth’s surface are subject to protection from induced seismic vibrations, especially during mining operations in the unique conditions of protected areas. In the field of extraction of natural resources of the Republic of North Ossetia-Alania with such conditions, a number of geophysical studies have been applied and interpreted. Results. Using the possibilities of mathematical modeling by the finite element method, the operation mechanism of compressive stresses in the zone of their interface of the ore whole with the host array is determined. Quantitative criteria for assessing the state of the developed space, depending on its filling or isolation, are obtained. It is proposed to assess the hazard of destruction of the Earth’s surface in relation to the maximum stresses in the model to the tensile strength of the material. The results of modeling anthropogenic stresses on low-molecular materials are presented. It is established that the maximum stresses in the elem ents of the cleaning chamber develop at the maximum value of the lateral expansion coefficient. It is shown that the filling of the developed chamber space reduces the stress level depending on the strength of the filler. It is determined that in the case of the option with isolation of the developed space without filling, the stress concentration for these conditions is maximum. The information obtained on the behavior of the ore-containing massif is relevant for the design of mining operations during the resumption of mining operations of the Sadon mines, as well as for deposits with similar conditions of localization of mineralization, both when using traditional technologies and when extracting metals with new promising technologies with drilling at the site of localization of mineralization. © 2023, Geophysical Institute of the Vladikavkaz Scientific Centre of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

With their potential for intramolecular charge transfer, these molecules can have bright prospects in optoelectronic device manufacturing. In this work we describe a novel bis-semiquinone complex of nickel and о-quinone annulated with a 1,3-dithiol-2-thiocarbonyl fragment and the peculiarities of thin-film deposition of this compound on different substrates. It is shown that a thin film can maintain the crystal structure of the original complex. A photovoltaic effect is detected in sandwich structures with an aluminum cathode. It is anticipated that further optimization of the structure of such sulfur-rich molecules will prodive solid-state ensembles with promising photovoltaic and/or photodetecting properties. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Aggregation; Compression isotherm; Floating layers; Langmuir-Schaefer films; O-quinone complexes; Photoconductivity; UV/Vis spectra","","","","","","IOMC RAS Scientific Facilities Sharing Center, (RF 2296.61321 × 0017); Moscow Polytechnic University; Russian Foundation for Basic Research, РФФИ, (19–29–08039, 20–07–00181a, 20–47–370002); Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation, Minobrnauka, (FZZM-2020–0006)","Funding text 1: The work was supported by the Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation in the framework of the state task for Ivanovo State University (No FZZM-2020–0006 ) and partially supported by the RFBR (Grants No 20–07–00181a , No 19–29–08039 ), RFBR and Ivanovo Region (Grant No 20–47–370002 ).

It is assumed that the analyzed pillar has a full-crystalline structure, in which there is a horizontally oriented crack. The dimensions of this crack exceed the characteristic size of the elementary volume. The main horizontally oriented open crack in the pillar has technogenic origin and induces an additional internal stress field. On the other hand, the internal stress field, due to the structural features of full-crystalline rocks, contributes to the formation of vertically oriented cracks. Moreover, if they formed a main crack, then the pillar will lose stability, which can lead to an emergency. As a result, the stress state in the pillars is formed by a superposition of stresses induced by the external field and the field induced by the main crack. © 2023 Ugol' Journal Edition, LLC.

The article presents the results of studies of hydrodynamic processes in the quarries of the Klinskoye deposit using methods for controlling them in rock masses. The Klinskoye deposit is planned to be developed by open pits: Klinskoye and Vostochny (hereinafter referred to as Klinskoye), which have a common surface contour, as well as Western, located 370 m north of Klinskoye. Materials and methods. The work was carried out using hydrodynamic, graph-analytical, hydraulic methods, as well as on the basis of probability theory and mathematical statistics. In rocks with pronounced fracturing, to determine the hydrogeological parameters, 5 hydrogeological wells were drilled, located in the direction of the prevailing fracturing and perpendicular to it. Results. It has been established that the main features and conditions of watering of the field are determined by the following factors: climatic conditions of the region; the amount and mode of precipitation and the intensity of evaporation; a complex system of multidirectional faults; features of aquifers; non-pressure regime of fissure-ground underground waters. Discussion. During the operation of the lower part of the section and the drainage of the zone of watered faults, most likely, the influence of drainage from the quarries of the Klinskoye deposit on the systems of domestic and drinking water supply of settlements, as well as the zone of sanitary protection of water supply sources, will not occur, due to the fact that the calculation was made for pressure fractures – veined groundwater of aquifers not used for these purposes. Conclusion. A set of studies has been carried out, including: analysis and generalization of scientific and technical information in the areas of predicting the stability of quarry walls and sloping soil structures, methods for monitoring the state and properties of a rock mass; monitoring of geo-mechanical and hydrodynamic processes in techno-genic soil mass. © 2023 North Caucasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, State Technological University.

The main features of this model include the following. One of them points to the adequacy of the model, which takes into account the interaction of cracks with each other. The second feature is related to the result obtained in the form of a control parameter, which makes it possible to consider the mathematical model as the mathematical support of the information system. The following conclusions are drawn from the analysis of experiments: the crack propagation in geomaterials is caused by the interaction of the crack tip with an ensemble of moving microdefects under the influence of external loads; control parameters are the length and speed of crack propagation, the speed and distance between moving microdefects. Using the dimensional method, a nondimensional control parameter is obtained. Values of this parameter determine the processes of stable and unstable propagation of the crack system. © R.K.

Concentration of attention is a critical cognitive function that impacts learning. This study involved 129 healthy schoolchildren aged 8–10 years (spanning grades 2 and 3) from a regular secondary school in Kirov, Russian Federation. A “physical education minute” (PEM), consisting of various physical exercises, was introduced during the middle of a regular lesson for the experimental group (EG), while the control group (CG) continued with their regular studies. Concentration and attention were assessed before and after the PEM using the Bourdon test. The Bourdon test results indicated a significant decrease in concentration during the lesson for the CG (p < 0.001), while the EG exhibited significant improvement in concentration after the PEM (p < 0.001). The effect size was large, demonstrating a substantial impact of this break for physical activity on concentration. It can be concluded that implementing a set of exercises in the form of a PEM in the middle of a lesson significantly improves concentration among students aged 8–10. This study underscores the effectiveness of integrating short breaks for physical activity into the daily classroom routine, ultimately benefiting students' attention, learning, and overall educational experience. Further research could explore additional factors affecting concentration and the long-term effects of the PEM on cognitive development. 2023 Polevoy, Cazan, Padulo and Ardigò.","concentration; health; lesson; physical education; schoolchildren","","","","","","","","Noor S., Haseen F., Tomal L.A., Noor N., Assessment of electronic gadgets use and its’ effects on daily life and health of primary school children, J Prev Soc Med, 39, pp. 78-87, (2020); Radwan N., Kabbash I.A., Abd-Ellatif E., Abu-Elenin M., Bullying and associated common health manifestations among primary school children in Tanta city, Egypt, Egyp Fam Med J, 5, pp. 4-19, (2021); Verma N., Bajpai P.K., Health status of primary school children: study in urban slums of lucknow, Int J Community Med Public Health, 8, pp. 2228-2232, (2021); Miheeva A.I., The importance of physical education in modern schools, Theor Appl Sci, 110, pp. 224-232, (2022); Singh L.S., A global perspective of physical education in school, Int J Pharmamedix India, 7, pp. 38-41, (2019); Caamano-Navarrete F., Latorre-Roman P.A., Parraga-Montilla J., Jerez-Mayorga D., Delgado-Floody P., Selective atten-tion and concentration are related to lifestyle in Chilean schoolchildren, Children (Basel), 8, (2021); Gelabert J., De la Vega R., Palou P.P., Muntaner-Mas A., The effects of a moderate-to-high intensity interval exercise training programme on selective and sustained attention in schoolchildren aged 11 and 12, J Hum Sport Exerc, 18, pp. 1-15, (2022); Kainov A.N., Kuryerova G.I., (2019); Gurev S.V., (2022); Livak P., Viatokha V., Melnyk Y., Meaningful content of physical education minutes in primary school lessons in the context of some research, Hum Sci Curr Issues, 2, pp. 225-232, (2021); Prysyazhniuk S., The use of small forms of active rest to improve the mental capacity of second or third students elementary school classes, Sci J Natl Pedagogical Dragomanov Univ, 3, pp. 119-125, (2020); Masini A., Marini S., Gori D., Leoni E., Rochira A., Dallolio L., Evaluation of school-based interventions of active breaks in primary schools: a systematic review and meta-analysis, J Sci Med Sport, 23, pp. 377-384, (2020); Oldfield R.C., The assessment and analysis of handedness: the Edinburgh inventory, Neuropsychologia, 9, pp. 97-113, (1971); Nemov R.S., Psychodiagnostics, (2020); Zakharova L.M., Zakharova V., Influence of motor activity on the development of voluntary attention in children aged 6-7 years in rural and urban micro-community, Int Educ Stud, 11, pp. 126-131, (2018); Hopkins W., Measures of reliability in sports medicine and science, Sport Med, 30, pp. 1-15, (2000); Cohen J., Statistical power analysis for the behavioral sciences, 2nd ed, (1988); Dyrla-Mularczyk K., Giemza-Urbanowicz W., The influence of physical activity on the functioning of the nervous system and cognitive processes–research review, Neuropsychiatr I Neuropsychol, 14, pp. 84-91, (2019); Lopez-Vicente M., Forns J., Esnaola M., Suades-Gonzalez E., Alvarez-Pedrerol M., Robinson O., Et al., Physical activity and cognitive trajectories in schoolchildren, Pediatr Exerc Sci, 28, pp. 431-438, (2016); Gejl A.K., Bugge A., Ernst M.T., Tarp J., Hillman C.H., Have M., Et al., The acute effects of short bouts of exercise on inhibitory control in adolescents, Ment Health Phys Act, 15, pp. 34-39, (2018); Siersbaek G.M., Have M., Wedderkopp N., The effect of leisure time sport on executive functions in danish 1st grade children, Children (Basel), 9, (2022); Brown K.A., Parikh S., Patel D.R., Understanding basic concepts of developmental diagnosis in children, Transl Pediatr, 9, pp. S9-S22, (2020)","L.P.

It is shown that a higher rate of cooling of the stir zone and the heat-affected zone leads to an approximate 1.5–2% increase in the tensile strength of the joint and metal in the stir zone (seam) compared with FSW in air. The strength factor of the joints is 0.85 to 0.86. The average size of grains in the stir zone of the underwater welded 1901T1 alloy plates is 5.33 μm, whereas in the case of FSW in air the average size of grains in the seam is 9.12 μm. During tensile tests, the fracture of the weld joint formed in 1901Т1 alloy by FSW in air and underwater starts in the zone of thermo-mechanical impact and develops through the heat-affected zone. In the case of FSW underwater, the length of the heat-affected zone is approximately 1.7 to 2.5 times less than that observed in the case of FSW in air. The hardness of the stir zone after FSW in air is similar to that of the base metal, whereas under FSW underwater it exceeds that value. Additional ageing, i.e. after FSW, at the temperature of 170 oC for 2 hours leads to decreased hardness of all zones of the joint produced by FSW in air and underwater. Both after welding in air and underwater and additional ageing at 170 oC for 2 hours, the fracture of the metal in the stir zone obtained as the result of tensile testing is distinctly ductile, with typical pits at the surface. The intercrystalline corrosion of the base metal is 85 μm. During FSW in air, both the heat-affected zone (90 μm) and the stir zone (the seam metal) (96 μm) are equally prone to intercrystalline corrosion. At the same time, during FSW underwater the depth of intercrystalline corrosion is reduced to 27 μm in the seam metal and to 35 μm in the heat-affected zone.

The relationships among macrostructure, microstructure, mechanical properties, and failure modes of welded joints of HSLA 420 steel were studied. An optical microscope was employed to describe the microstructure, macrostructure, and geometry of the welds, while their mechanical properties and failure modes were characterized via tensile shear tests. It turns out to be that the weld nugget mainly contains lath martensite. The results of the microhardness test show that the microhardness of the fusion zone (FZ) is superior to those of the heat-affected zone (HAZ) and base metal (BM). The increase in heat input brings about a decrease in FZ martensite hardness, but the hardness distribution is more uniform. The grain size of the FZ is 38 µm, 51 µm, and 62 µm when the welding time is at the levels of 11 cycles, 15 cycles, and 19 cycles, while its values increased by about 58% as the welding current increases from 7.2 to 9.6 kA. As the welding time increases, the differences between the maximum hardness and minimum hardness decrease from 74 to 54 HV. In the tensile shear test, interfacial fracture and pullout fracture were observed, followed by BM sheet tearing. Evidently, the weld nugget with the size of 4t0.5 (t = sheet thickness) will not bring about pullout fracture. Furthermore, existing standards for determining the acceptable load capacity of welded joints cannot guarantee good welding quality. Finally, moderate welding current (from 8.4 to 9 kA) and long welding time (above 15 cycles) should be used to obtain the welded joints with sufficiently large FZs which present good mechanical properties in the tensile shear test. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","High-strength steel; Mechanical properties; Metallurgy; Resistance welding","Advanced high strength Steel; Automotive industry; Fracture; Heat affected zone; High strength alloys; Martensite; Microhardness; Microstructure; Shear flow; Spot welding; Base metals; Fusion zones; High strength low alloys; High-strength steels; Macrostructures; Mechanical attributes; Mechanical failures; Tensile shear test; Weld nuggets; Welding time; High strength steel","","","","","Russian Science Foundation, RSF, (22–29-20095)","The authors are thankful for the financial support offered by the Russian Science Foundation (22–29-20095).

The article presents the results of research on the problem of waste disposal of ore processing by changing the properties of metal-containing raw materials. The research methods are based on experiments using the method of electrochemical activation of metal extraction processes. Results. The purpose of the study is formulated as modernization of the technology of extraction of metals from ores by leaching in relation to non-ferrous metals. It has been determined that the tailings of the enrichment of metal ores contain valuable metals that are not fully extracted by traditional methods of enrichment, which form compounds dangerous to the environment. It is determined that the leaching efficiency increases due to a decrease in the activated reaction area of the working solution with minerals containing the extracted metal. A mathematical description of the leaching kinetics is given depending on the surface area of the particles and the applied energy. Models for evaluating technology options and determining savings from the use of the phenomenon of mechanical activation are proposed. Discussion of the results. It is shown that a promising direction of metal extraction is combined chemical enrichment and mechanical activation with high energy in a disintegrator. It is determined that the activation of minerals in the disintegrator increases the recovery of metals by more than one and a half times, and the combination of grinding and leaching processes increases it even more. Conclusion: during the disposal of ore dressing waste, the mechanochemical activation of binders increases the extraction of metals, reducing risks to the environment. © 2023 North Caucasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, State Technological University.

At the temperature of 450oC, the Al – 1.5 Mn – 0.5 Ca alloy was found to experience a transition from the (Al) + Al6Mn + Al10CaMn2region to the (Al) + Al10CaMn2+ Al4Ca region.

The factor that defines decomposition of the solid solution of (Al) at the annealing temperatures of 350 and 400oC includes a rising free energy of phase boundaries, which increases their diffusion permeability.

This requires the application of confirmatory techniques based on the results of real experiments, for example, through optical 3D-scanning. The realization of the techniques requires preparing the blank prior the experimental stage. The combined technique of speckle interferometry and digital image correlation allows estimating deformations on the outer linear surfaces, but does not indicate deformations of products with curved surfaces and inside the specimen, which requires performing an additional numerical simulation. © 2023 National Research Nuclear University.

In order to have a successful and safe life, we should refrain from any selfishness, harming others, malice and humiliating people and should always be forgiving, selfless and humble in relationships. Interpersonal relationships are one of the most important components of human life from birth to death; none of the potential capabilities of humans grow except in the shadow of interpersonal relationships. Learning correct interpersonal relationships is very important in creating mental health, personality development, identity finding, increasing job productivity, increasing quality of life, increasing adaptability and selffulfilment. The current research was conducted with the aim of explaining the relationship between communication skills based on Islamic teachings and students’ life skills. In this research, Ayats [verses] from the Holy Quran that are related to communication skills and relationships between people in Islamic society have been discussed, and then the components of effective communication and its role in students’ life skills have been explained. This research discusses the following factors: human dignity and self-esteem, tolerance and compromise skills, forgiveness skills, accountability skills, justice orientation skills and individual behaviour skills. Contribution: The results of this research indicate that according to students’ imitation of teachers, paying special attention to the components of communication skills according to Islamic teachings in schools can affect students’ life skills. Therefore, by improving the mental health of the youth, and consequently the health of the society will be affected and it will bring excellence to the society. © 2023, The Authors.","communication skills; education; Islam; life skills; religion; school","","","","","","","","Ahmadi M., Hatami H., Ahadi H., Asadzadeh H., The effect of communication skills training on self-efficacy beliefs and academic progress of female students, Bimonthly Scientific-Research Journal of a New Approach in Educational Management, 4, 16, pp. 105-118, (2012); Amedi A.I.M., Ghurar al-Hikam wa Durar al-Kalim, (1990); Amin Far F., The role of religious teachings in the education of students in schools, The fifth international conference of psychology and social sciences, (2015); Bos-van Hoek D.W., Visser L.N.C., Brown R.F., Smets E.M.A., Henselmans I., Communication skills training for healthcare professionals in oncology over the past decade: A systematic review of reviews, Current Opinion in Supportive and Palliative Care, 13, 1, pp. 33-45, (2019); Faqihi A.N., Youth and peace, (2009); Majlisi M.B., Bihar Al-Anwar Al-Jami’a Al Durar Al-Akhbar Al-Imam Al-Athar, 19, (1985); Sharifi I., Communication skills in the Quran, Research Journal of Quranic Studies, 8, 30, pp. 151-184, (2016); Shafiei Mazandarani S.M., Sources of peace in Islamic psychology, (2004); Sobhaninia M., Way and customs of life, (2013)","I.

Vernadsky State Geological Museum of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russian Federation","Mining regions have accumulated waste rock dumps and tailings, many of which are man-made ore deposits with concentrations of useful elements to compare with the concentrations of metals in natural deposits. The challenge of extracting metals from waste rocks and materials can be solved by using hydrometallurgical methods that involve technological operations performed in a certain sequence in order to change the ore properties through the decomposition of chemical compounds of metals and their transfer into the transportable phase. Theoretical foundations for the technology have been created in Russia and experience in processing low grade ores has been accumulated, but the issue of processing of metal-containing mining and concentration wastes is far from being resolved and requires comprehensive research to achieve environmental and economic effects. The article presents the results of research into specific features of hydrometallurgical processes that are carried out as part of mining operations in underground blocks and stockpiles on the daylight surface. A historical note is given on the development of the leaching technology. Such research is necessary to justify rational parameters for recovery of metals lost during pyrometal- lurgical processing in the ore processing products. The appropriateness of the ""mine hydrometallurgy"" term is justified. The need to implement the potential of the leaching technology is proved in order to enhance the comprehensive use of mineral resources when recovering metals from the tailings of ferrous metals processing. The specific character of hydrometallurgical processes within the framework of mining production is described, and the ways to obtain the positive effects are outlined, e.g. differentiation of metals with similar properties, simplification of recycling processes, and reduction of negative impact on the environment. It is shown, that the metal leaching technology when applied to the mining process offers advantages in comparison with the traditional technology and can be implemented at the operations of Kursk magnetic anomaly by integrating a unit for metal leaching from ore concentration and metallurgical tailings into the existing process chain. The advantages of leaching technology in increasing the completeness of mineral resources utilization through the recovery of metals from waste resources are demonstrated. © 2023, Scientific and Industrial company 'Gemos Ltd.'.

Technologies of extraction of valuable ores with filling of the worked-out space with hardening mixtures provide the best technical and economic indicators of production. Their disadvantage is the dilution of ores by the material of laying mixtures under the influence of natural and technological stresses. Of particular relevance are the issues of use for the management of mining pressure of enrichment waste. Materials and methods. To achieve this goal, a set of studies is carried out, including generalization of experience, fullscale measurements of rock mass parameters, laboratory studies and process modeling. The priority direction of solving the problem is the differentiation of the value of the angle of inclination of the cameras on the tab array. Results. It is determined that the efficiency of the full use of the subsoil is increased by optimizing the design of the purification chambers based on the regularities of the extraction of ore reserves in the interface zone with the laying array. It is proposed to combine the rock and hardening bookmark in a single process to increase the efficiency of work, creating volumetric compression conditions in ore-containing arrays that improve its performance, including reducing the dilution of ores. It is shown that the geo-mechanical aspect of combining technologies is to create a jamming zone of rock formations with the formation of a structure capable of withstanding emerging stresses. It was found that the inclination of the walls of the cleaning chambers in contact with the laying array towards the developed space in the range of 5-25 degrees reduces compressive stresses by approximately 1.6 times. Conclusion. Taking into account geodynamic factors when choosing a technology for the development of stressed arrays opens up prospects for replacing expensive components of the filling mixture with recyclable cheap industrial waste. The research results can be used in the improvement of technologies for the extraction of valuable ores at existing enterprises and the design of new technologies for the development of ore deposits, as well as in the educational process. © 2023 North Caucasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, State Technological University.

The optimal selection from the available methods variety strives to get the best “price–quality–time” ratio. The issues with finding the best solutions to achieve the set goals with limited resources have always been faced by people. The concept of decision-making considers a decision a conscious choice of one of many options. At present, in connection with the growing needs of practice, an interdisciplinary scientific direction is actively developing. One of its sectors is the mathematical theory of decision-making under many criteria.

Automated process control systems, as a set of characteristics related to the ability of an object to satisfy certain needs, are one of the most important indicators of the quality of complex technical systems consisting of a large number of interacting mechanisms, apparatus and instruments. Their failure can lead to accidents and emergencies, resulting in large economic losses, destruction of industrial facilities, and sometimes human casualties. Methodology and research methods. The solution to the assigned problems is based on modern methods of artificial intelligence, automatic control theory, mathematical modeling of technological processes, and mathematical statistics; graph theory; decision theories; apparatus of mathematical logic; set theory and systems analysis. Discussion of research results. The article presents the results of studies of the patterns of ventilation and technological processes in coal mines. It has been established that studies of patterns in coal mines are becoming more relevant in connection with the formulation of the task of modernizing production and the Russian economy as a whole. It has been revealed that the methodological foundations for the synthesis of control decisions that ensure the achievement of a stable state make it possible to formulate acceptable organizational and managerial decisions and evaluate their effectiveness using metered characteristics of the proximity of vaguely described states. Conclusion. Based on the research carried out, new theoretical and applied problems were posed and solved, system connections and patterns of the ventilation technological process (VTP) were identified, models, methods and algorithms for automated ventilation technological process control systems (ACVTP) were developed, aimed at increasing the efficiency of the technical air supply system coal mines. The theoretical foundations for modeling and controlling ventilation and technological processes have been created, including concepts, models, methods and control algorithms. The research results can be useful in controlling ventilation and technological processes. Conclusions on the article. The article presents the results of studies of ETP conducted in coal mines. It has been established that, using the developed methodology, it is possible to: design high-tech equipment with specified quality indicators for intelligent control systems; choose from a variety of structural diagram options the best in terms of operational efficiency; carry out structural-parametric adjustment and change the types of mathematical models, both for an individual element and for the ETP as a whole; identify the weakest points in the HTP automated control system and adapt the methodology for controlling ventilation and technological processes, evaluate the effectiveness of using structural redundancy. Suggestions for practical applications and directions for future research. The research results can be useful when carrying out mining operations at all enterprises where air supply is necessary. © 2023 North Caucasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, State Technological University.

The basis for the study was a child burial from the Tovsta Mohyla mound as one of the few not robbed burials of steppe Scythia of the 4th century BC. Meanwhile, the burial is regarded as a text (in the semiotic sense). The method developed by the author for reconstructing the semantics of images on the costume elements of the buried led to the conclusion that they reflect a complex of ideas about dominion over the midzone of the mythological universe. The article rebuilds the semiotic status of things that accompanied the buried which allowed us to conclude that the child in the Scythian society inherited the place in the social space belonging to his kin. The child’s burial from the Tovsta Mohyla mound belonged to the Scythian “priest-king”. The buried has not yet passed the initiation so the grave lacks things that are peculiar only to the male or female inventory. Prospect of further research is connected with the methodology development for reconstructing the semantics of the Scythian burial as a single complex. © 2023 High Anthropological School University.

The question arises about the necessity of applying a new direction in global science — imagology — for such research. The novelty of this study lies in being the first to examine material from a publication that has not attracted much attention from Russian scholars from the perspective of this field. The relevance of the study is determined by the need to uncover a new perspective in studying the British press during wartime. The contexts of mentions about the Battle of Stalingrad in the weekly ‘British Ally’ are presented. It is proven that although an admiring attitude towards the Soviet victories at Stalingrad slips through in some articles, the publication does not give special attention to the Battle of Volga. It is shown that the newspaper emphasizes the idea of the selfless resistance of the British army against Nazi Germany in Africa and Sicily, as well as their desire to open a second front. The authors conclude that the newspaper presents these events and desires as equivalent to the struggle of the Soviet people, which does not find approval or desired response among the newspaper’s readers (the Russian people). © 2023, Tsentr Nauchnykh i Obrazovatelnykh Proektov.

This problem is relevant for rolling mills, which provide the output and determine the quality of products of metallurgical companies. Making up monitoring systems requires the development of digital shadows and coordinate observers, the direct measurement of which is either impossible or associated with numerous difficulties. These coordinates include the spindle torque applied by the spring-transmitting torque from the motor to the rolling stand rolls. The development and research are conducted by the example of the electromechanical systems of the horizontal stand at the plate mill 5000. The stand electric drive characteristics are given, and the emergency modes that cause mechanical equipment breakdowns are analyzed that. The relevance of analyzing transient torque processes in emergency modes has been accentuated. The paper points to the shortcomings of the system for elastic torque direct measurement, including low durability due to the harsh operating conditions of precision sensors. It also highlights the need to install the measuring equipment after each spindle. The disadvantage of the previously developed observer is the function of calculating the electric drive speed derivative. This causes a decrease in noise immunity and signal recovery accuracy. The contribution of this paper is building a digital elastic torque observer that has advantages over conventional technical solutions, based on the theoretical and experimental studies. The technique for virtual observer adjustment was developed and tested in the Matlab-Simulink software package. For the first time, a comprehensive analysis was conducted for spindle elastic torques in emergency modes that caused equipment damage. An algorithm was developed for an emergency shutdown of a stand electric drive in the worst-case mode of strip retraction between work and backup rolls, due to the overlap of the strip on the roll. Further, the algorithm was tested experimentally. The criteria for diagnosing pre-emergencies was then justified. An adaptive motor-braking rate controller was developed. The developed observer and emergency braking system are in operation at the mill 5000. Long experimental research proved the efficiency of dynamic load monitoring and the reduction in the number of equipment breakdowns. © 2023 by the authors.","development; elastic torque; electromechanical system; emergency braking; emergency modes; implementation; observer; rolling mill; system","","","","","","Moscow Polytechnic University","This work was financially supported by the Moscow Polytechnic University within the framework of the grant named after Pyotr Kapitsa.","Murri M., Streppa E., Colla V., Fornai B., Branca T.A., Digital Transformation in European Steel Industry: State of Art and Future Scenario.

The parameters of localization and scattering of an electromagnetic wave in a partially absorbing medium were studied depending on the geometric configuration of the output tract. The interpretation of the obtained initial results was carried out within the framework of the (1+4)D extended space model (ESM). The extended space model is formulated in (1+4)-dimensional space time-coordinate-interval action. An additional spatial coordinate in the ESM is the interval, which in the ESM has the physical meaning of the action. In the dual (1+4)D space energy-momentum-mass, the interval (action) in the ESM corresponds to the mass. ESM considers the question of the emergence of a non-zero variable mass for a photon and its localization under the influence of an external field. © 2023 Russian Academy of Natural Science.

In general, under the action of an incident elastic wave, six elastic waves are formed in an anisotropic layer. The total effect of these waves determines the stress-strain state of the layer and is displayed in the spectra of waves scattered by the layer into the environment. The scattering spectra and acoustic stresses were modeled by solving the equations of motion of a continuous medium and the generalized Hooke's law. This system of differential equations is solved with respect to the components of the displacement vector and the stress tensor in the Cartesian coordinate system. The Peano-Becker method of solving a system of differential equations by means of a matrix exponential is used. The components of the displacement vector and the stress tensor at two opposite boundaries of the layer with thickness d are expressed through each other using a sixth-order transfer matrix T = exp(Wd), where matrix W is determined by the parameters of the layer under study. The method of scaling and multiple squaring is used. According to this approach, T = (exp(Wd/m))m. A method for selecting the scaling parameter m is proposed to estimate the errors of truncation and rounding when calculating exp(Wd/m). A guaranteed accuracy and the best efficiency of calculations of all elements of the matrix exponential of the sixth order, in comparison with other known methods, is provided by the use of the method of polynomials of the principal minors of matrix W. The modeling of elastic wave scattering spectra (conversion coefficients) and stress dependences on the angles of incidence for cubic crystal layers is given using the example of indium. The interpretation of resonances of acoustic stresses arising in the crystal layer under the action of a shear wave incident on the crystal is given. © PNRPU.","diffraction; elastic waves; matrix exponent; principal minor method; scaling and squaring method; truncation errors","","","","","","","","Dieulesaint E., Royer D., Ondes élastiques dans les solides, (1974); Kristally kvantovoi I nelineinoi optiki [Crystals of quantum and nonlinear optics], (2000); Rose J.L., Ultrasonic Guided Waves in Solid Media vol 9781107048, (2014); Egorov G.P., Volkov A.A., Opredeleniye kriticheskogo urovnya vnutrennikh napryazheniy v tonkikh plonkakh [Determi-nation of the critical level of internal stresses in thin films], Composites and nanostructures, 8, 3, pp. 187-203, (2016); Prakash S., Modulating optical properties of Lithium Niobate through acoustic stress Material Today, Proceedings, 47, pp. 1535-1537, (2021); Brekhovskikh L.M., Godin O.A., Acoustics of layered media, (1990); Belyayev Yu.N., Method for calculating acoustic stresses in six-beam diffraction in layered media, PNRPU Mechanics Bulletin, 4, pp. 82-92, (2018); Belyayev Yu.N., The method of polynomials of principal minors in calculations of acoustic stresses in an anisotropic layer, AIP Conference Proceedings, 2053, (2018); Belyayev Y.N., Diffraction Resonances of Acoustic Stresses in the Crystal Layer, IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering, 581, (2019); Kittel C., Introduction to Solid State Physics, (2005); Angot A., Compléments de mathématiques a l'usage des ingénieurs de l'élektrotechnique et des telecommunications, (1982); Gantmacher F.R., The theory of matrices, 1, (1959); Alonso P., Ibanez J., Sastre J., Peinado J., Defez E., Efficient and accurate algorithms for computing matrix trigonometric functions, J.

The paper attempts a scholarly insight into medieval historical chronicles for a new comprehension of Derbend-Nameh by Muhammad Avabi Aktashi (sixteenth–seventeenth centuries) that stands at the beginnings of Dagestani prose. Goals. The study seeks to identify the literary task set forth by the medieval author when he set to create the historical/literary narrative, reveal some meanings hidden therein, and show how the author influences a reader with the aid of stylistic techniques and expressive means. Methods. The work employs the cultural/historical and receptive methods, the latter be manifested (implemented) via ‘readers’ expectations’, certain derived genre norms, implied correlations between fiction and reality, text and context. The hermeneutic method proves most instrumental in revealing opportunities for multiple interpretations of one and the same text. Results. Our study attest to the author used not only documents and facts from the preceding Tawarikh-i Derbend-Nameh (The Book of Derbent Stories) but also invested his own knowledge of ancient fiction and undertones — to establish the genre of historical prose in Kumyk literature. This is evidenced by the author’s appeal to the key characteristic features of fiction: abundance of folklore legends, fragments from Arab, Oriental and European chronicles and fiction texts; hyperbolized narration about the size of Derbent and the Derbent Wall; fantastic elements, images of historical personalities, such as Zulkarnein Iskander (Alexander the Great), Kubad-Shah, Abu-Muslim and others; the formal and compositional division of the text (war between Arabs and Khazars, war between Persians and Khazars, ruling years of Abu Muslim); hidden meanings of the narrative about Khazars and the city of Anji (emotional narrative of battles attended by Khazars and Muslims); reflections on the turning point in history, impacts on the reader’s feelings by means of literary devices and artistic expressions. Conclusions. Despite the book by Muhammad Avabi Aktashi deals with the history of Derbent, it clearly shows the author’s intention and literary task to shed light on another city, the ancient Anji, as well as on the tragic collapse of the Khazar state. It is shown that the book served a landmark at the beginnings of Kumyk prose — and gave impulse to the latter’s further evolution. © 2023 Kalmyk Scientific Centre of Russian Academy of Sciences.

Utilizing qualitative research methods, this investigation scrutinizes reporting documents, exploiting indicators of occupational injuries and identified causes of such injuries. A combination of monographic and statistical methods was leveraged to process the results. An examination of occupational risks reveals that a substantial proportion is linked to production equipment, flawed technological processes, and substandard conditions of industrial facilities and structures. Informed by the outcomes obtained, recommendations were formulated for establishing and employing feedback mechanisms. This approach facilitated the systematization of causes leading to industrial injuries and the modification of regulatory documentation to curtail occupational risks. The study advocates the development of specific checklists featuring exemplar questions and a unified database for work-related injuries. It also proposes amplifying the legal status of documents that prescribe requirements for production processes. The implementation of these solutions is projected to result in a reduction of occupational risks and work-related injuries. © 2023 WITPress.

It is assumed that stratums in pillars have a polycrystalline structure. Effective tensors of elastic modulus are used to determine the deformation properties of stratums in pillars. To calculate these elastic characteristics, final expressions are obtained. Calculations based on these expressions give different values of the effective tensors of elastic modulus for stratums in pillars. When such stratums are too close to each other in the pillar, shear stresses arise in them, leading to the formation of a crack. This crack forms an additional stress field, which are determined with appropriate mathematical expressions. Under the action of rock pressure, an inhomogeneous stress field is induced into the stratums at the structural level. As a result, the stress state in the pillars is formed by a superposition of stresses induced by the external field and the field induced by the main crack between stratums. © R.K. Khalkechev, Yu.M.

Zabelin (1820–1908). The historical and archaeological concepts of the scientist attracted the attention of contemporaries and followers, while the pedagogical views of I.E. Zabelin are being considered for the first time. Turning to the history of Russian pedagogical thought is especially relevant in the Year of the Teacher and Mentor, as it allows you to learn from the examples of the past to see the civic essence of teaching history and literature, especially in the situation of information warfare. The authors introduce archival materials into scientific circulation, uses the diary entries of the scientist and the memories of his students. I.E. Zabelin's pedagogical activity unfolded in 1853–1869 at the Konstantinovsky Land Surveying Institute and the School of Land Surveying Topographers in the era of acute discussions about the future of the Russian education system. I.E. Zabelin stood outside the political forces of that time, but his pedagogical views were clearly progressive, echoed the ideas of the father of Russian pedagogy, K. D. Ushinsky (1823–1871). I.E. Zabelin was outside the political forces of that time, but his pedagogical views were clearly progressive, echoed the ideas of the father of Russian pedagogy, K. D. Ushinsky (1823–1871). I.E. Zabelin taught his students to love and understand the ideas and aspirations of his people, educated them into worthy citizens and patriots of his country, instilled a culture of thinking and expressing his thoughts. The scientist's attention to reading, to students' understanding of historical facts and a sober assessment of the political situation sounds relevant today. I.E. Zabelin applied advanced scientific methods, used progressive educational publications, developed author's courses based on historical sources, realized the need for the principle of clarity in teaching. The pedagogical community and the management of educational institutions highly appreciated the efforts of the historian. He read his subject in a fascinating and emotional way, his lectures were remembered by students for many years. The personality of I.E. Zabelin, who brilliantly combined the traits of both a scientist and a teacher, who saw the need not only to teach the subject, but also to educate the younger generation, is a worthy example for our contemporaries.

Methods and structure of the study. Diagnostics was carried out on the basis of the SBI AE in the city of Moscow, the Moscow Complex Sports School of the Olympic Reserve ""Sever"" of the Moscow Sports Committee. An analysis was made of “video recordings of the following competitions: the championship of Moscow (2021, 2022); championship of the Central Federal District (2022); championship of Russia (2022); All-Russian tournament (2022). With the help of video analysis, 300 competitive fights of boys aged 14-15 years old (I youth category, III sports category, II sports category, I sports category, candidate for master of sports) were analyzed in 100 fights of representatives, conditionally divided into three weight categories: light-up to 46 kg, medium-from 50 to 60 kg and heavy-from 66 kg and above. To determine the level of development of various types of coordination abilities of qualified judoists, 66 athletes were tested, of which 23 athletes were in the light weight category, 25 in the middle and 18 in the heavy weight category. Results and conclusions. It has been established that the level of development of certain types of coordination abilities has differences depending on belonging to a certain weight category. The identified ""leading"" components of the technical and tactical arsenal and the most significant types of coordination abilities of each weight category should be used as the basis for intragroup differentiation in the organization of the training process. © 2023, Teoriya i praktika fizicheskoy kul'tury i sporta.

Methods: To assess the impact of the risks of foreign economic activity, a methodical approach to the assessment of risks at enterprises is developed. The base of the study is composed of 10 selected enterprises in the Moscow region, Russia engaged in foreign trade activities and the production of high-tech products. Results: Assessment of the riskiness of foreign economic activity and the degree of risk manifestation in the process of foreign trade activities allows enterprises to regulate their activities to ensure their security and promote greater competitiveness. Conclusion: The conducted analysis demonstrates that foreign economic risks considerably affect foreign economic activity. The ranking of enterprises according to the degree of manifestation of risks confirms that the competitiveness of enterprises is sensitive to foreign economic risks. © 2023 The Author(s).","assessment; enterprise; foreign economic activity; model; risks; sustainable development","","","","","","","","Akimova L.M., Akimov O.O., Liakhovich O.O., State regulation of foreign economic activity, Scientific Bulletin of Polssia, 4-1, 12, pp. 98-103, (2017); Aldulaimi S.

The scope of the project is to fill the lacunae, to disambiguate homonymy, to facilitate the choice of appropriate translation of a linguistic term and understanding of its context. The issue of the absence of Russian—Chinese—English and Chinese—Russian—English terminological dictionaries and the general desynchronization of terminological systems have been repeatedly mentioned in scientific works focused on the description of the language for special purposes. The search for a solution to these theoretical issues will help to find an algorithm for organizing the corpus of terms both within individual scientific disciplines and in interdisciplinary areas of arts and humanities. Multilingual corpus of terminology in linguistics implies the development of methodological recommendations and a complex of teaching materials including the digital ones, which will help foreign students to use the terms according to their level of language proficiency. The project is a continuation of a collective work oriented to the research of a language for professional communication. Language for professional communication is a functional type of a natural language the units of which transfer special knowledge. The absence of this knowledge makes professional communication impossible in the ways of perception, interpretation, translation and, creation of scientific texts in writing. © 2023, RUDN UNiversity.

The problems of mining production solved at the design stage of mining enterprises are designated as derivatives of the efficiency function depending on the performance of the system, the total costs of development and operation, the amount of damage due to unreliability, time, etc. It is shown that one of the methods for optimizing the design support of mining operations is the modeling of the main mining processes. The purpose of the study is formulated as detailing the concept of ensuring occupational safety when engaging in the production of substandard metal-containing mineral raw materials. It is noted that the underground mines are among the most complex objects for which it is advisable to use multi-variant design with step-by-step optimization of intermediate design solutions. The extraction of mineral raw materials is characterized by an increase in volumes and accumulation of aggressive processing waste with a dangerous impact on the environment. It is noted that technogenic deposits are formed without considering the subsequent use of tailings, for example, storage with the creation of geochemical barriers. A new area of metal leach-ing into a disintegrator was proposed, which allows to produce products from substandard raw materials with less energy consumption. The characteristic of innovations in mining is given. A mathematical model is recommended that allows considering the features of technologies taking into account the costs of ensuring the safety of employees. It is concluded that the optimization of mining production is characterized by the extraction of metals using technologies with a combined mechanochemical effect. © 2023, STC Industrial Safety CJSC.

The results obtained by quantum-chemical calculations for the monomers and dimers of non-mesogenic TTT series and their comparison with truxenone derivatives having identical substituents made it possible to establish the reasons that deprive series 1 of mesogenity. Compounds of both TTT series possess good solubility in organic solvents and capable of specific interactions with solvents in the ground and excited states. They form fluorescenting floating layers and thin films. An analysis of the fluorescence spectra showed a high potential for their application, in particular, in the field of molecular sensing and precise non-invasive control. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","columnar mesomorphism; fluorescence; spectral properties; thin films; Tristriazolotriazines","","","","","","Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation, Minobrnauka, (FZZM-2020-0006, FZZM-2023-0009)","This work was supported by the Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation [projects no.

The analysis of weld geometry shows that the heat-affected zone (HAZ) width, nugget diameter, and nugget area tend to decrease rapidly, while the nugget height tends to increase with the weld repetitions until the welding heat input becomes too small to form an effective nugget. The maximum displacement and failure energy of the welded joints show a decreasing trend during the welding electrode failure process, while the peak load increases slightly until the 88th weld and then decreases. The cavities and pores in the nugget mainly appear after the 176th spot weld. The electrode diameter increases during welding. The reason for the increase in electrode diameter may be that the contact area between the electrode and the BH 220 steel sheets becomes smaller in the welding process, which causes the continuous sticking phenomenon between the electrode and the BH 220 steel sheets. In the absence of alloying, the edge of the electrode is geometrically deformed, while Cu–Zn–Fe alloying occurs in the area in contact with the BH 220 steel sheet. © 2022 by the authors.","electrode life; operating parameters; resistance spot welding; tensile properties","","","","","","Russian Science Foundation, RSF, (22-29-20095)","This investigation is supported by the Russian Science Foundation (22-29-20095).","Zhao D., Ivanov M., Wang Y., An investigation of the laser welding process for dual-phase steel via regression analysis, IOP Conf.

The study also determinate the factors affecting the sustainability of supply chains in construction Theoretical framework: Supply chain integration in many industries is based on integrated enterprise resource and relationship processing systems (ERP), but the construction industry has traditionally lagged behind in these processes. The need to create effective relationships in supply chains and increase the resilience of supply chains in construction has become evident in the context of the pandemic. However, the weak formalization of these processes in construction has led to the need to find acceptable methods for choosing directions for increasing the sustainability of supply chains in this industry. Methodology: This is a descriptive-based study. Approaches to factors of the supply chain stability were researched and systemized and from this the situations for the increasing stability of the supply chains are determinated. The choice of a model of the increasing stability of the supply chains was determined by the analytic hierarchy process. Hierarchy analysis was used as a method for selecting a scenario for increasing the sustainability of supply chains in construction. Findings: The results of the research carried out to conduct a multi-criteria choice using the opinions of experts in the construction industry. The choice of scenarios for increasing sustainability is due to the fact that the introduction of adaptive information technologies allows to take into account all groups of selected factors, while ensuring synchronization of production planning, product shipment and inventory management, increasing market feedback, ensuring that production volumes correspond to product demand, as well as reducing logistics costs and the price of products for the end customer. Research, Practical & Social Implication: The study contributes to a better understanding crucial factors of the sustainability of supply chains in construction. The processes of analyzing and evaluating factors contribute to improving the sustainability of supply chains in construction, by focusing on critical factors, adopting them according to the requirements of the construction. Originality/value: Based on the presented results, concluded that the scenario formation of increasing sustainability of the sustainability of supply chains by the introduction of adaptive information technologies allows to take into account all groups of selected factors, while ensuring synchronization of production planning, product shipment and inventory management, increasing market feedback, ensuring that production volumes correspond to product demand, as well as reducing logistics costs and the price of products for the end customer. © 2023 AOS-Estratagia and Inovacao.

The problem here is the limited usability of processing and conversion tailings at their content of metals higher than the allowable maximum. This fact defines the goal of the research: the theoretical and experimental validation of usability of tailings after removal of metal impurities down to the sanitary standards for the purposes of backfilling. The research methods include the generalization and systematization of the experience of metal leaching from processing tailings in disintegrators. The increased volume of metal production calls for new resources from mining practices, including increased application of mining technologies with cemented backfill. It is shown that one of the ways of solving the problem connected with shortage of raw materials is mechanochemical processing of low-grade minerals with improvement of qualities of available cheap agents by integration of the mechanical and chemical effects. Recovery of metals in leaching in a disintegrator reaches the value which allows using the tailings in the mining industry without the health-based constraints, including production of binding agents. The mechanochemical technology of tailings treatment allows expanding the range of backfilling with cemented backfill made of tailings. For this reason, the comprehensive utilization of mining and metallurgy waste after mechanochemical activation in disintegrators can be a realistic reserve for the improvements and achievements in underground mineral mining. © 2023 Publishing house Mining book.

The problem of combining parts made of such materials into a single assembly unit is of relevance today, alongside the development of new high-tech aluminium alloys. This paper examines the applicability of laser welding for butt joining thin hot-rolled sheets of aluminium alloy Al – 5 Zn – 1.3 Mg – 1 Ca (Fe, Mn, Cu, Si) (wt. %). An unhomogenized ingot of the experimental alloy was hot-rolled at the temperature of 450o C down to the thickness of 2 mm (reduction degree of 90%). Two sheets were joined together on a robot laser welding machine in an optimum mode, which ensures a visual quality of the seam with minimum porosity of the weld. Laser power — 2,400 W, laser beam speed — 10 m/sec, focal distance — 217 mm, shielding gas consumption rate — 15 L/min. A study of microstructure and physical and mechanical properties helped evaluate the effect of the selected welding parameters on weld seam formation. It was found that the laser processing helps form a high-quality weld joint with no cracks and with low porosity. The strength of such weld is at the following level: σв = 240 MPa, σ0,2 = 170 MPa, with the elongation of δ = 3%. The ultimate strength of the weld joint is 83 % and the yield point is 92.5% of the strength of the base metal. The obtained results suggest that laser welding can potentially be applicable to joining sheets made of experimental Al – 5 Zn – 1.3 Mg – 1 Ca (Fe, Mn, Cu, Si) (wt. %) alloys, which differ from 7ххх series alloys due to the presence of calcium-containing eutectic that ensures high crack resistance and good casting and welding processability. © 2023, Ore and Metals Publishing house.

Low-alloy Cu – Fe alloys are precipitation hardening alloys which acquire greatly increased strength and electrical conductivity after heat treatment. A primary smelting and casting process has been developed for such alloys on the basis of commercially pure metals and alloys, as well as a secondary melting process applicable to waste copper-iron alloys. Application of the foundry process implies a repeated reutilization of in-house waste generated after every new melt. Such waste should be used as burden materials when casting alloys. This research was aimed at developing a process for utilization of secondary materials (i.e. in-house waste) to produce a low-alloy Cu – 2.65% Fe alloy. The authors examined the mechanical properties and electrical conductivity of such alloy after secondary melting. To obtain a quality melt, diffusion carbon deoxidation should be replaced with bulk phosphorus deoxidation. The resulting alloy has high strength and electrical conductivity, especially after heat treatment. High aggregate properties of double remelted Cu – 2.65% Fe alloys were established. This conclusion is also confirmed by the results of an electron microscopy study of the as-cast and as-heat treated alloy.

Methods: the pedagogical experiment was carried out on the basis of a comprehensive school, the city of Kirov, Russia. The study involved children 15-16 years old in the amount of 52 people. During the study period, 30 physical education lessons were held in each class. Children from the control group were engaged in the usual program, and children from the experimental group additionally performed the «Burpee» exercise. Endurance in children was determined by the test «2000 m», and the volume of attention was determined by the test «Schulte Tables». The study used Excel and BioStat to determine Student’s T-test. Results: after the pedagogical experiment, the indicators in the control group in the «2000 m» test improved by 1.9% (p>0.05), and in the «Schulte Tables» by 4.8% (p>0.05). In the experimental group, the performance improved significantly in the «2000 m» test by 9% (p<0.05) and in the «Schulte Tables» by 15.8% (p<0.05). Conclusion: if 15-16-year-old schoolchildren perform the «Burpee» exercise in physical education classes, then the indicators of endurance and volume of attention will improve significantly. In this case, physical activity should be individual. © 2023, Ibn Sina Trust.

RSPS involves the SPS consolidation process and chemical reactions. SPS parameters such as the heating rate, maximum temperature, and dwell time influence the kinetics of the chemical reaction. To control the sintering process, it is critical to understand the relationship between the SPS parameters and different reaction modes. For a highly reactive Ni–Al system, we directly compare the consolidation kinetics under various SPS conditions. Comparing the RSPS and SPS schemes, we unequivocally conclude that the reactive mode permits an overall higher densification for the considered system. Two RSPS strategies are identified: i) RSPS under self-sustained reaction conditions occurring under a high heating rate and large volume-to-surface ratio, and ii) RSPS under relatively slow reaction rate conditions. The question of which strategy is best is addressed based on an analysis of the microstructures and mechanical properties of the fabricated materials. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Aluminides; Consolidation; Mechanical alloying and milling; Mechanical properties; Reaction synthesis","Aluminum alloys; Binary alloys; Heating rate; Mechanical alloying; Reaction kinetics; Spark plasma sintering; Aluminides; Comparatives studies; Condition; Consolidation process; Maximum temperature; Mechanical alloying and milling; Ni-Al intermetallics; Reaction synthesis; Reactive spark plasma sintering; Refractory compounds; Intermetallics","","","","","","","Miracle D.B., Overview No. 104 the physical and mechanical properties of NiAl, Acta Metall.

The activating agent was applied by two methods: impregnation and subsequent autoclave treatment. When the powder was activated by the impregnation method, the crystal sizes remained at the initial level of 0.17–0.19 μm. After the autoclave treatment, the crystal sizes increased to 0.31–0.53 μm. Samples of cold sintering ZnO with relative density up to 0.96 and average grain sizes 0.29–0.86 μm were obtained. ZnO powders and ceramic samples were analyzed using SEM, TGA/DSC, and XRD to reveal the effect of the powder activation method and cold sintering conditions on the material microstructure. The effect of ammonium chloride concentration on grain growth and microstructure of ceramic samples is shown. It was found that the average grain size of ceramic samples with an increase in additive concentration passes through a minimum. In cold sintering of the autoclave activated powder, the effect of reducing the average grain size was observed. The results of this work are discussed on the basis of the idea of the solid-phase mobility of the crystal structure arising when interacting with an aqueous medium. © 2023 by the authors.","cold sintering; microstructure; oxide ceramics; thermo-vapor treatment; zinc oxide","Additives; Chemical activation; Chlorine compounds; Grain growth; Grain size and shape; II-VI semiconductors; Impregnation; Microstructure; Pressure vessels; Sintering; Application method; Autoclave treatments; Average grain size; Ceramic samples; Cold sintering; Crystal-size; Oxide ceramics; Sintering process; Thermo-vapor treatment; ZnO ceramic; Zinc oxide","","","","","MIREA - Russian Technological University, RTU MIREA; Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation, Minobrnauka, (0707-2020-0034); Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation, Minobrnauka; Lomonosov Moscow State University, MSU","Funding text 1: The work was carried out with the use of equipment of the Centre of Collective Usage «Joint Educational and Scientific Center for Collective Use» of MIREA—Russian Technological University (Agreement No. 075-15-2021-689) and with the use of equipment of the Centre of Collective Usage «High Technology in Engineering» of Moscow Polytech (Number for publications: 0699-2017-0005).

From the perspective of Islam, it has been also affirmed that two people have the same thoughts and opinions in one centre point of love in brotherhood, so fraternal feelings are not merely limited to kinship and consanguinity. In this line, the Holy Qur’an states that we have come to make you brothers with each other; not a brotherhood from parents, but an Islamic one, which is highly appreciated in the Islamic society. In addition, a believing brother can never be filled when his fellow believer is hungry, and he cannot be clothed while the other is with nothing on. Islam further considers all Muslims as one family and calls everyone brothers and sisters or siblings. The true Muslims of any race and tribe as well as any language and age thus have a deep sense of brotherhood with each other, even if one lives in the Eastern parts of the world and the other in the West. In sum, this article aimed to investigate the role of religious teachings in strengthening believers’ brotherhood in the Islamic society. For this purpose, firstly, the definition of religious brotherhood was provided; secondly, religious brotherhood has been described based on the Holy Qur’an. Contribution: This article helped gain a new insight into the role of Islamic teachings in strengthening religious brotherhood in the Islamic society. Besides, the indicators of religious brotherhood were extracted and then enlightened according to the Ayat (viz. verses) from the Holy Qur’an. © 2023. The Authors.

Unfortunately, these properties are lost in thin films due to aggregation quenching effect (ACQ) and internal filter effect, limiting BODIPY application in optical devices. The introduction of bulky substituents into dye molecule should affect the supramolecular organization of BODIPY in thin films. Therefore, using the example of β-benzyl-substituted complex (1) and bis(BODIPY) dimer (2), we study the influence of bulky substituents at the β, β'-positions of these BODIPY molecules on their aggregation behavior in mono- and multilayer Langmuir-Schaefer (LS) films. A comparative analysis of BODIPY spectral properties in LS and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) films has been carried out. It was shown that the presence of bulky benzyl-substituents in β-positions of pyrrole rings promotes the formation of H- and J-type aggregates in multilayer LS-films of the dye 1 and BODIPY dimer 2. The dye 1 predominantly forms H-type aggregates, while for the dye 2, the equilibrium is shifted towards the formation of J-type aggregates. The studied BODIPYs with a low content of up to 1 wt. % exhibit intense fluorescence being included in PMMA films. The results obtained give the possibility to use more efficiently thin-film structures based on the studied BODIPY thin films in optoelectronics. © Sherudillo A. S., Antina L. A., Kazak A.

Methods and structure of the study. 52 people (28 boys and 24 girls) took part in the scientific experiment. There were 16 boys and 12 girls in one group. There are 13 boys and 11 girls in the other group. The study of the section ""Kettlebell lifting"" in accordance with the curriculum of the discipline ""Athletics"" was given 8 hours of classroom work and 8 hours of independent work. A formative experiment was carried out, during which two different approaches to teaching students of the Faculty of Physical Education were applied. The first approach assumed the mastery of three competitive exercises at each practical session, and the second one-the sequential study of competitive exercises in the following order: clean and jerk; long cycle push; jerk. In one group, where the first approach to training was implemented, the classes were structured as follows: at the first lesson, there was a theoretical introduction to the technique of performing all competitive kettlebell lifting exercises, after which the students began to master the technique; in the second or third lesson, students mastered the technique of lead-up exercises; at the fourth lesson there was a mastering of all competitive exercises in full coordination and their performance for evaluation. In another group, where the second approach to learning was implemented, the classes were structured as follows: at the first lesson, students mastered the push exercise; the second lesson-a long cycle push; the third is a jerk; on the fourth-there was a development of all competitive exercises in full coordination and their implementation for evaluation. Results and conclusions. The results of the study showed the effectiveness of using the methodology, which is based on the sequential study of first a push, then a long cycle push and a jerk of the kettlebell, as evidenced by the results of mathematical processing using White's T-criterion. © 2023, Teoriya i praktika fizicheskoy kul'tury i sporta.

A reference trajectory of the robot's movement is needed to estimate errors and evaluate a quality of the localization. In this article, we propose the Prior Distribution Refinement method for generating a reference trajectory of a mobile robot with the Monte Carlo-based localization system. The proposed approach can be applied for both indoor and outdoor environments of an arbitrary size without the need for expensive position tracking sensors or intervention in the testing infrastructure. The reference trajectory is generated by running the algorithm over a so-called Particles' Transition Graph, obtained from a resampling stage of Monte Carlo localization. The prior distribution of particles is then refined by forward-backward propagation through the graph and exploring the connections between particles. The Viterbi algorithm is applied afterwards to generate a reference trajectory based on refined particles' distribution. We demonstrate that such an approach is capable of generating accurate estimates of a mobile robot's position and orientation with the only requirement of moderate quality of localization system being used as a core algorithm for iterative optimization.  © 2013 IEEE.","benchmark trajectory; Ground truth trajectory; localization; monte carlo localization; particle filter; reference trajectory; robot tracking; smoothing","Bandpass filters; Iterative methods; Mobile robots; Navigation; Robot applications; Trajectories; Viterbi algorithm; Benchmark trajectory; Ground truth; Ground truth trajectory; Localisation; Location awareness; Monte Carlo localization; MonteCarlo methods; Particle filter; Reference trajectories; Robot tracking; Smoothing; Monte Carlo methods","","","","","","","Dellaert F., Fox D., Burgard W., Thrun S., Monte Carlo localization for mobile robots, Proc.

The modeling of metal leaching processes using mechanical activation of polymetallic raw material components is particularly important in expanding the application of mining tailings as inert fillers of filling mixtures. This study is aimed at detecting the rotor speed factor on the chemical and mechanochemical effect of zinc yield growth from polymetallic tailings of the mining industry. In this regard, the purpose of this study was to improve the modeling of metal leaching processes using mechanical activation by improving the compositions of the filling mixtures. The methodology of the work included several comprehensive studies: the mechanical activation of tailings during zinc leaching from pulp in the DESI-11 disintegrator; the activation of enrichment tailings and the formation of a filling mass with different parameters of the component composition; the curing of cubic samples and their testing on the IP-1250 press. The Vi Improved text editor was used to prepare the algorithms for deterministic methods of three-dimensional interpolation in the Python language. The experimental results were graphically displayed using Gnuplot. The study of the agitation leaching of the waste obtained from the Sadonskiy mining district results in the fact that the NaCl mass concentration decreased from 13 to 1% and the H2SO4 concentration stabilization within 0.5 to 0.6% led to a 3-time increase in the zinc yield from the pulp, according to the polynomial law (from 28 to 91%). The obtained results expand the idea of the mechanism of the strength gain by the filling mass under mechanical activation on the components of the filling mixture, as well as changes in the efficiency of zinc leaching at different ratios of two types of lixiviants (sulphuric acid and sodium chloride) in the leaching solution. © 2023 by the authors.","enrichment tailings; mechanical activation; ore; stable mining; zinc leaching","Chemical activation; Extraction; Filling; Mining; Ores; Sodium chloride; Zinc; Enrichment tailing; Filling mixtures; Leaching process; Mechanical activation; Mechano-chemical activation; Metal leaching; Polymetallic; Stable mining; Zinc extraction; Zinc leaching; Leaching","","","","","","","Tanvar H., Mishra B., Comprehensive utilization of bauxite residue for simultaneous recovery of base metals and critical elements, Sustain.

To determine the optimal approach to managing education’s development in the social investment model of Russia’s economic growth with alternative mechanisms of standardization and deregulation. The results of the research show that absolute standardization, as well as absolute deregulation of higher education, does not allow achieving significant results in the sphere of increase in quality of life in Russia. The determined and substantiated optimal scenario of managing the development of higher education in Russia to increase the quality of life envisages a foundation on a flexible approach, which envisages the combination of standardization and deregulation. It is recommended to entirely refuse branches in favor of main universities, refuse government financing in favor of fee-based education and refuse diversification of education forms in favor of the intramural form of study. This allows raising the quality of life by 13.26% (up to 70.87 points). For practical implementation of this approach, it is offered to allow each region to form their own programs of development of higher education with the foundation of the main federal principles.

It is found that gas-phase surface fluorination provides an increase in the wear resistance of experimental samples in all cases due to a combination of nanotexturing and chemomorphological transformations of the surface layers of the modified polymers. The significant dependence of the nanotexture on the technique and mode of modification is demonstrated using the original approaches to the quantitative characterization of the experimental samples’ surfaces’ scanning electron microscopy-images (formed with the scanning electron microscope). It is shown that the surface fluorination not only makes possible to significantly compensate for the increase of the friction coefficient of bulk-modified UHMWPE in comparison with the original one but also provides a nonlinear multiplicative increase in the wear resistance. © The Author(s) 2023.","bulk-surface modification; fluorination; mathematical modeling; synergistic effect; UHMWPE","Adhesives; Fluorination; Friction; Halogenation; Molecular weight; Nonmetallic matrix composites; Scanning electron microscopy; Tribology; Wear of materials; Wear resistance; Adhesive properties; Bulk modification; Bulk surfaces; Bulk-surface modification; Friction coefficients; Mathematical modeling; Surface fluorination; Surface-modification; Synergistic effect; Ultra-high molecular weight polyethylenes (UHMWPE); Ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylenes","","","","","Moscow Polytechnic University","The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The reported study was funded by Moscow Polytechnic University (Grant named after V.E.

For continuous monitoring of the well drilling process, an experimental setup was developed that operates on the basis of the use of the phase-metric method of control. Any movement of the bit causes a change in the electrical characteristics of the probing signal. To obtain a stable signal from a bit immersion depth of up to 250 m, a frequency of probing electrical signals of 166 Hz and an amplitude of up to 500 V were used; sampling rate (analog-to-digital converter) ADC - 10101 Hz. To identify the state of the drill string and the bit according to the graphs of dependences of changes in the electrical characteristics of the probing signal on time, the authors of the article investigated a number of deep learning methods, based on the results of the research, a line of capsule neural network (CapsNet) methods was selected. The authors have developed two modifications of 1D-CapsNet and Windowed Fourier Transform (WFT) - 2D-CapsNet. To identify the transition between two rock layers with different properties, WFT-2D-CapsNet showed an accuracy of 99%, which is 2-3% higher than the results of modern rock studies based on measurement-while-drilling (MWD) and logging-while-drilling (LWD) methods. The WFT-2D-CapsNet method unambiguously detects self-oscillations in the drill string and detects the good condition of the bit with an accuracy of 99%.  © 2013 IEEE.","artificial intelligence; CapsNet; drilling optimization; engineering; geophysical monitoring; neural networks; Robotics","Analog to digital conversion; Deep learning; Delay control systems; Geophysics; Neural networks; Three dimensional displays; Time delay; Capsule neural network; Drilling optimization; Drilling process; Geophysical monitoring; Neural-networks; Three-dimensional display; Time-delays; Vibration; Windowed Fourier transforms; Process control","","","","","Russian Foundation for Basic Research, РФФИ, (23-29-10126)","The work of Dmitry Surzhik was supported by the Intelligent System for Monitoring the Integrity of the Subgrade of the Railway through the Section II ''Materials and Methods'' under Grant (RFBR) 23-29-10126.","Lin L., Guo H., Guo F., Lv Y., Liu J., Tong C., A novel domain adversarial time-varying conditions intervened neural network for drill bit wear monitoring of the jumbo drill under variable working conditions, Measurement, 208, (2023); Aribowo A.G., Wildemans R., Detournay E., Wouw De N.Van, Drag bit/rock interface laws for the transition between two layers, Int.

The active medium is defined as one that reacts to external impacts. This includes coal seams that are being mined. Elastic waves generated by vibration contribute to emergence of multidirectional forces within the seam, which generates several gas-conducting systems of fractures. Coal shares the same property with all the other fractured media, i.e. brittleness, which is manifested by a sharp decrease in hardness due to destruction of the massif's structure when coal is shaken. This phenomenon can be utilized in the practice to enhance gas recovery from seams, in particular, when using vibration impact on the coal matrix. Studies confirm that exposure to low frequencies gener- ates vibrations within the seam, which have to match the natural vibration frequency of the rock matrix and cause a resonance effect in the coal seam. An increase in the rock mass fracturing takes place within the vibroacous- tic field, and a significant decrease is observed in bonding of the methane molecules with coal. This phenomenon causes several effects that impact the state and properties of the low-permeability gas-saturated coal seam. The vibrations that propagate within the pay zone as elastic waves change the structure of the coal seam and significantly increase the occurrence of alternating forces to produce new fracture systems and to stimulate methane escape from the coal porous medium. © 2023 Ugol' Journal Edition, LLC.

Methods and structure of the study. In the course of the work, the level of manifestation and correlation dependence of power, temporal and spatial basic and specific kinesthetic coordination abilities, as well as indicators of physical, technical, tactical, psychological readiness and competitive activity of young football players were determined. Results and conclusions. It was found that in young football players the density of interaction of spatial, power and temporal parameters is higher in the structure of basic kinesthetic coordination abilities in comparison with specific ones. The closest connection was found with the indicators of technical parameters. The nature of the mutual influence has its own characteristics - in the structure of specific ones, the largest number of reliable correlations are formed by spatial parameters of kinesthetic coordination abilities, and in the structure of basic ones - with temporal and power ones. Based on the data obtained, it is necessary to plan tasks in the programs for improving special coordination abilities in parallel with tasks for technical improvement, improve basic coordination abilities within the preparatory stage of the macrocycle, and pay more attention to tactical training at the special preparatory stage. © 2023, Teoriya i praktika fizicheskoy kul'tury i sporta.

In the course of the study, a corpus of argumentative essays (90 works) written in English by 4th-year students of technical specialties of the Technical Institute (branch) of the North-Eastern Federal University named after M.K. Amosov (n = 45), Moscow Polytechnic University (n = 45) and the University of International Business (Almaty, the Republic of Kazakhstan) (n = 45) was considered. The observation lasted 13 weeks and consisted of three stages. According to the research results, 71.1% of students from the Technical Institute (branch) of NEFU correctly used the essay superstructure, 57.7% – macrostructure, and 42.2% – microstructure. It was found that the learning strategies focused on the meta-discursive approach are better developed among bilingual students. At the same time, monolingual students from Moscow Polytechnic University showed the following results: 28.8% – mastered the superstructure of writing an argumentative essay, 35.5% – macrostructure, and 46.6% – microstructure. Further research will be aimed at separating these categories and a step-by-step analysis of the process of argumentative essay writing following a meta-discursive sequence. The study limitations were manifested in the bilingualism of one category of students and the monolingualism of the other, which significantly affects the outcome of the data obtained. © 2023, Slovenska Vzdelavacia Obstaravacia.

To improve the mechanical properties, an alloy of the Al–Zn–Mg–Ca–Fe system was proposed. In this alloy, when Fe and Ca are added, compact particles of the Al10CaFe2 compound are formed, which significantly reduces the negative effect of Fe on the mechanical properties. Because of the high solidification rate (about 600 K/s) during cylindrical ingot (~33 mm) production, the electromagnetic casting method (ECM) makes it possible to obtain a highly dispersed structure in the cast state. The size of the dendritic cell is ~7 μm, while the entire amount of Fe is bound into eutectic inclusions of the Al10CaFe2 phase with an average size of less than 3 μm. In this study, the effect of radial shear rolling (RSR) on the formation of the structure and hardening of the Al–8%Zn–3.3%Mg–0.8%Ca–1.1%Fe alloy obtained by EMC was studied. Computer simulation of the RSR process made it possible to analyze the temperature and stress–strain state of the alloy and to select the optimal rolling modes. It was shown that the flow features during RSR and the severe shear strains near the surface of the rod (10 mm) provided a refining and decrease in the size of the initial Fe-containing particles. © 2023 by the authors.","aluminum alloy; Al–Zn–Mg–Ca–Fe system; electromagnetic casting; FEM simulation; radial shear rolling; stress–strain state","Computational electromagnetics; Electromagnetic fields; Finite element method; Hardening; Iron alloys; Particle size analysis; Rolling; Shear flow; Solidification; Strain; Al-Zn-Mg; Al–zn–mg–ca–fe system; Electromagnetic casting; Fe-systems; FEM simulations; Radial shear; Radial shear rolling; Shear rolling; Solidification rate; Stress strain state; Aluminum alloys","","","","","Moscow Polytechnic University; Russian Science Foundation, RSF, (22-19-00128)","The study was supported by a grant from the Russian Science Foundation (project no. 22-19-00128) (EMC, RSR, FEM, SEM) and by the Moscow Polytechnic University within the framework of the grant named after Pyotr Kapitsa (TEM, HV).","Hatch J.E., Aluminum: Properties and Physical Metallurgy, (1984); Polmear I., StJohn D., Nie J.F., Qian M., Physical metallurgy of aluminium alloys, Light Alloys, pp. 31-107, (2017); Mondolfo L.F., Aluminium Alloys: Structure and Properties, pp. 806-841, (1976); Glazoff M., Khvan A., Zolotorevsky V., Belov N., Dinsdale A., Casting Aluminum Alloys: Their Physical and Mechanical Metallurgy, (2018); Miao Z., Tao L., Chunnian H., Jian D., Enzuo L., Chunsheng S., Jiajun L., Naiqin Z., Evolution of microstructure and properties of Al–Zn–Mg–Cu–Sc–Zr alloy during aging treatment, J.

Methods and structure of the study. 32 highly qualified football players aged 19-30 took part in the formative pedagogical experiment. Two groups were formed from among the subjects-control (CG, n=16 people) and experimental (EG, n=16 people), which were completed taking into account the indicators of motor and functional readiness. Highly qualified female football players of the experimental group at the stages of the annual cycle of training were engaged in the developed and implemented program for improving motor activity, taking into account the variation in the intensity of training on small venues. Results and conclusions. By the end of the formative pedagogical experiment, highly qualified football players from the EG were significantly superior to the players from the CG in such quantitative parameters of game actions during the competition as passing the ball, kicking at goal, intercepting and tackling the ball in defense, as well as martial arts (p<0.05). The authors state that the introduction into the training program of highly qualified female football players in China of special game exercises on small areas, performed with different intensity, not only contributes to an increase in the motor activity of the players during the match, but also ensures the growth of quantitative indicators of technical and tactical methods of the game. © 2023, Teoriya i praktika fizicheskoy kul'tury i sporta.

The procedure of selecting a method of withdrawal of mined-out areas from operation in thin and average thickness ore body cutting in hard rock mass is ambiguous, which disables the economic benefit of the phenomenon at the preserved operational safety. The objective of the research is the theoretical and experimental validation of usability of the retained strength of fractured rocks in optimized withdrawal of mined-out areas from operation. The structural mechanics provisions are used to examine the phenomenon of the retained strength actualization in discrete rocks as a result of their wedging up with a view to optimizing ground control parameters in rock mass surrounding an ore body. The integrated studies have amended the concept of withdrawal of mined-out areas from operation in underground mining of structurally damaged deposits. The information on a specific strong ore body and the role of tectonics in its behavior during mining is given. The rock mass research data are generalized with delineation of geotechnical sites. The design procedure is presented for withdrawal of mined-out areas from operation using the low-cost technologies of underground excavation isolation and cemented paste backfill; as against the known methods, the proposed procedure provides the quantitative indicators on a case-by-case basis for different conditions of ore localizations. The studies allow drawing conclusion on feasible actualization of the retained strength in fractured rocks given their wedging up in withdrawal of mined-out areas from operation, which, in proper conditions, can lead to an optimized solution for the test problem with integrated effect produced. The scientific novelty of this research consists in the circumstantiation of the known mechanics provisions relative to the stress–strain rock mass. © 2023 Publishing house Mining book.

One of the most energy-hungry phases in mineral processing is grinding using autogenous mills. The aim of this study is to estimate the electric energy demand of the mills using the methods of the statistical and correlation analyses. In conformity with the aim, the scope of the research encompasses: the mill statistics analysis, the correlation of the energy consumption and productiveness of the mills, the definition of the specific energy consumption of the mills. Using the experimental research findings and the statistical design methods, the computation procedure is developed for the energy response and specific energy consumption of the autogenous grinding mills; the procedure contains the necessary and sufficient number of criterion-based checkouts of the initial statistical data, and provides the basic parameters of the statistical law, as well the estimates of the correlation coefficient and the coefficients of the linear regressional relationship between separate samplings. It is found that the productiveness and energy consumption of the autogenous grinding mills have a low correlation coefficient, which points at the weak connection between the parameters P and Q. The Student's t-test confirms that at a = 0.05, the correlation coefficient of the productiveness Q and the specific energy consumption w, and the coefficients of the linear regressional relationship are significant. For minimizing the specific energy demand, it is recommended to operate within the optimum mode range at the maximum allowable capacity of the mill at 136.5 t/h. © 2023 Publishing house Mining book.

They are designed for cutting, welding and surface modification of various materials as part of laser machines. The power of laser radiation is one of the most important parameters of a laser that determines its technological capabilities. The radiation power is controlled by changing the ionization pulses frequency of high voltage pulses with duration of 100 ns, given with a frequency of 1-5 kHz. The step response of the laser is experimentally obtained. Laser radiation is fed to a thermoelectric mirror-detector with thermo-EMF anisotropy, which measures its power. After preliminary amplification, the differential signal from the mirror-detector is recorded by a digital oscilloscope. A delay in the change in the laser radiation power relative to the control signal was established. The delay is 1487 μs that is explained by the fact that several ionization pulses are required for the initial exciting of the gas volume before the start of radiation generation. The initial section of the step response and damped oscillations are explained by the presence of a protective choke in the main discharge source connection circuit. The choke slows down the rise in current during the short circuit of discharge, allowing circuit breakers to turn off the power supply. To simulate the transient process, the step response of the oscillating circuit is used. The original signal was filtered to remove noise that does not allow determining the parameters of the step response. To determine the spectrum of the step response, fast Fourier transform is carried out, frequencies introducing noise were cut out, and the inverse fast Fourier transform is performed. According to the step response obtained after filtering, the parameters of the modeling step response are determined. Based on the parameters of the step response, the laser transfer function is calculated. It makes possible to proceed to the calculation of the optimal radiation power controller, which ensures the best quality of the transient process. © 2023 Obninsk Institute for Nuclear Power Engineering, National Research Nuclear University 'MEPhI'.

The following tasks were carried out: mathematical modeling of thermohydraulic processes in different slot channels having constant height along them (from 0.3 mm to 0.5 mm); analysis of the influence of the slit channels' height, the number of distancing elements in rows, the distance between rows and the total number of elements on the average value of the Nusselt number and on the pressure drop; analysis of the effect of changes in speed and temperature conditions on thermal and hydraulic characteristics. The most important results are the following facts: the influence of the relative location of the distancing elements on the thermohydraulic characteristics of the flow is negligible; changes in the temperature and speed regime of the laminar flow practically does not affect the intensity of convection in the matrix channels; an increase in the height of the slot channel leads to a relatively small decrease in the average value of the Nusselt number. The significance of the results obtained is that they can be the basis for adjusting the methods of design calculations of rotary heat exchangers taking into account the decrease in thermal efficiency caused by the presence of distancing elements in the channels of their matrices. Recommendations can be made to minimize the number of distancing elements without considering their mutual location. © 2023 The Author(s).","convection; heat exchange; hydraulic loss; microturbine; Nusselt number; regenerative heat exchanger","","","","","","","","Banihabib R, Assadi M., The Role of Micro Gas Turbines in Energy Transition, Energies, 15, 21, (2022); Saha A.

Patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) show variability in clinical manifestations and prognosis depending on the epitope specificity of ANCA and the presence or absence of granulomatous inflammation. In this regard, it is important to identify the clinical and immunological phenotypes of AAV and a personalized approach to treatment. Microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) with antibodies to myeloperoxidase (aMPO) has a relatively high incidence of lung involvement and pulmonary fibrosis. We present our own clinical case of pulmonary fibrosis in MPA with aMPO and rheumatoid factor. Literature data are discussed. In cases of early arthritis and interstitial pneumonia, the possibility of AAV should be considered, a detailed examination is necessary to identify pathognomonic signs of AAV, including asymptomatic ones. Before prescribing immunosuppressants, the epitope specificity of ANCA should be determined. Treatment with rituximab, mycophenolate mofetil and nintedanib is discussed. © 2023 Ima-Press Publishing House.

Similarly, 45 of their classmates made up the MD somatotype group, in which 22 girls were muscular and 23 senior girls were digestive. Physical fitness testing and anthropometry were carried out at the beginning and at the end of each academic year. Results and conclusions. The analysis of the obtained results showed the predominance of endurance qualities in the structure of physical fitness development in girls of AT body type, and for schoolgirls of MD body type, the leading physical qualities are strength, speed-strength abilities and flexibility. This indicates the expediency of conducting separate training sessions with girls of the senior classes of astheno-thoracic and muscular-digestive body types within the framework of the school schedule. © 2023, Teoriya i praktika fizicheskoy kul'tury i sporta.

However, this rapid advancement is also polluting our air ambience. Hence real-time detection and estimation of hazardous gases/odors in the air ambiance has become a critical need. In this paper, a convolutional neural network (CNN) based multi-element gas sensor arrays signature response analysis approach has been presented to achieve higher accuracy in detection and estimation of hazardous gases. Accordingly, the real-time gas sensor array responses are spatially upscaled and processed on the edge, using lightweight CNNs. For the verification of our hypothesis, we have used a four-element metal-oxide semi-conductor (MOS)-based thick-film gas sensor array, fabricated by our group, by using SnO2, ZnO, MoO, CdS materials for detection and estimation of four target hazardous gases, viz., acetone, car-bon-tetrachloride, ethyl-methyl-ketone, and xylene. The four-element (2×2) raw sensor responses are first upscaled to 6×6 responses and a lightweight CNN is trained on 42 samples of 6×6 input vectors. The trained system is then tested using 16 unknown (not used during training) test samples of the considered gases/odors. All the 16 test samples are detected correctly. The Mean Squared Error (MSEs) of detection has been 1.42×10-14 while the estimation accuracy of 2.43× 10-3 were achieved for the considered gases. Our designed system is generic in design and can be extended to other gases/odors of interest. © 2013 IEEE.","convolutional neural networks (CNNs); electronic nose; gas sensor array; Internet of Things (IoT); Spatial upscaling","Acetone; Convolution; Electronic nose; Gas detectors; Gases; Internet of things; Neural networks; Thick films; Zinc oxide; Convolutional neural network; Detection and estimation; Gas odors; Gas sensor arrays; Hazardous gas; Internet of thing; Spatial upscaling; Test samples; Upscaling; II-VI semiconductors","","","","","Hub Foundation, ()/ECE/21-22/02/290, R&D/SA/I-DAPT IIT (); Networked Communication and Computation Laboratory; Banaras Hindu University, BHU, (IS/ST/EC-13-14/02)","This work was supported in part by the Networked Communication and Computation Laboratory (NCCL), Department of Electronics Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology (Banaras Hindu University) [IIT (BHU)], India, under Grant IS/ST/EC-13-14/02; and in part by Interdisciplinary-Data Analytics and Predictive Technologies (I-DAPT) Hub Foundation, IIT(BHU), India, under Grant R&D/SA/I-DAPT IIT (BHU)/ECE/21-22/02/290.","Penza M., Suriano D., Villani M.G., Spinelle L., Gerboles M., Towards air quality indices in smart cities by calibrated low-cost sensors applied to networks, Proc.

The experiments performed resulted in obtaining tubular nanoparticles of the vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) 50 Pm long and 5–10 nm in diameter. Wall thickness of the obtained tubes was 1.1 nm. It was experimentally established that type of the acid used was not affecting the resulting nanoparticles size, but was significantly effecting the shelf life. To increase the nanoparticles optimal shelf life, it is proposed to use the hydrochloric acid solutions as the peptizing agent. This method made it possible not only to increase the system stability, but also to raise the nanoparticles concentration up to 1 % of the mass. In the framework of experiments on studying the obtained particles surface characteristics, it was found that nanoparticles in the range of pH = 3.0–4.2 were negatively charged, and aggregation stability was mainly determined by the electrostatic factor. The proposed chemical technology could be used in industrial production of the vanadium pentoxide nanoparticles in various industries. © Author(s), 2023.","aggregative stability; aqueous dispersions; Synthesis; tubular nanoparticles; vanadium pentoxide","","","","","","Russian Science Foundation, RSF, (21-19-00367)","The work was supported by the Russian Science Foundation (project no. 21-19-00367)","Medhi R., Marquez M.D., Lee T.R., Visible-light-active doped metal oxide nanoparticles: review of their synthesis, properties, and applications, ACS Appl.

To obtain and study the properties including degradability of polymer composite materials (PCM) based on low-density polyethylene (LDPE) obtained by introducing an environmentally friendly additive comprising an oxo-decomposing additive (ODA) based on an amphiphilic polymer-iron metal complex, which accelerates the process of polymer degradation. Methods. PCMs based on LDPE and ODA were produced by processing in laboratory extruders in the form of strands, granules, and films. Thermodynamic properties were determined by differential scanning calorimetry in the temperature range 20–130°C. In order to assess the performance characteristics (physical and mechanical properties) of the PCM, tensile strength and elongation at break were determined. The biodegradability of PCM was evaluated by Sturm’s method, with the biodegradation index being determined by the amount of CO2 gas released as a result of microorganism activity, as well as composting by placing the PCMs for six months in biohumus. Changes in physical and mechanical properties and water absorption of the films during storage were evaluated. The photochemical degradability of the PCM was determined by exposing it to ultraviolet radiation for 100 h (equivalent to approximately one year of exposure of the films under natural conditions). The appearance of the composite samples following removal from the biohumus was determined using an optical microscope with ×50 magnification in transmitted and reflected light. Results. Following biodegradation by composting, the physical and mechanical properties of PCMs decrease by an average of 40.6%. This is related to the structural changes that occur in composites during storage in biohumus, i.e., the formation of a looser structure due to the development of large clusters of microorganisms that affect the formation of microcracks. It leads to the stage of fragmentation of the polyethylene matrix and indicates the progress of biological degradation of composites. In this case, the water absorption of the composite samples was 63% after 96 h of exposure. The biodegradability index determined by the Sturm method after 28 days of bubbling had changed by 82%, indicating an intensive biodegradation process. Exposure to ultraviolet radiation for 96 h resulted in the complete destruction of the PCMs, which turned into small “flakes.” This method is the most effective for the degradation of LDPE-and ODA-based PCMs. Conclusions. According to the results of the study of ODA-containing PCMs based on an amphiphilic polymer-iron metal complex, the tested filler-modifier can be recommended for the production of PCMs offering an accelerated degradation period. © I.Yu.

Three options of rigid elastic film preparation using isotactic polypropylene for successive deposition of an adhesive layer of a solution of macromolecular compounds and an electrically conductive layer of a graphite dispersion are proposed. The optimal order of operations for manufacturing electrical sensors with high sensitivity to changes in mechanical stress has been established, including preliminary cyclic deformation in the air to form open micropores as a result of “dry crazing”. A mathematical model has been developed, which predicts the mechanical stress and/or the change in mechanical stress of film strain gauges based on the change in the electrical resistance of the conductive layer in the 6–35% strain range with up to 700 relative strain sensitivity. © 2022, The Polymer Society, Taipei.","Conductive layer; Dry crazing; Mullins effect; Polypropylene; Strain gauge","Adhesives; Film preparation; Polymer films; Polypropylenes; Stresses; 'Dry' [; Conductive layer; Cyclic deformations; Dry crazing; Elastic films; High sensitivity; Isotactic polypropylene; Mechanical stress; Mullins' effect; Strain-gages; Strain gages","","","","","","","Cannon S.L., McKenna G.B., Statton W.O., J Polym Sci, 11, (1976); Ren W., Colloid Polym Sci, 270, (1992); Garcia-Leiner M., Song J., Lesser A.J., J Polym Sci, 41, 12, (2003); Park I.K., Noether H.D., Colloid Polym Sci, 253, (1975); Flynn C., Taberner A., Nielsen P., Biomech Model Mechanobiol, 10, (2011); Zhang L., Li H., Lai X., Gao T., Yang J., Zeng X., Appl A.C.S., Mater Interfaces, 10, pp. 41784-41792, (2018); Ding G., Jiao W., Wang R., Chu Z., Huang Y., J Mater Chem A, 19, pp. 712333-712342, (2019); Liu Y., Pharr M., Salvatore G.A., ACS Nano, 10, (2017); Hu Z., Xin Y., Fu Q., J Polym Res, 28, (2021); Yang H., Kim D., Abhishek K.S., Et al., MRS Online Proc Libr, 1312, (2011); Wu J., Li H., Lai X., Chen Z., Zeng X., Mater Lett, 280, (2020); Hu Y., Zhao T., Zhu P., Et al., Nano Res, 11, pp. 1938-1955, (2018); Wu Z., Yang F., Yang J., Yang P., Zhang X., Zhang T., Lu M., Macromol Mater Eng, 307, (2022); Lee K., Ju B., Appl Mater Sci, 5, 209, pp. 2082-2086, (2012); Palza H., Reznik B., Wilhelm M., Arias O., Electrical, Macromol Mater Eng, 297, pp. 474-480, (2012); Zhou C., Zhang Y., Hu C., Meng Y., Yu D., J Polym Res, 7, (2022); Sokolov A.K., Garishin O.K., Svistkov A.L., Mech Adv Mater Mod Process, 4, (2018); Garishin O.K., Shadrin V.V., Kornev Y.V., Mater Phys Mech, 42, pp. 445-454, (2019); Diani J., Fayolle B., Gilormini P., Eur Polymer J, 45, (2009); Lin Y., Li X., Chen X., An M., Zhang Q., Wang D., Chen W., Sun L., Yin P., Meng L., Li L., Polymer, 184, (2019); Marchenko E.S., Yasenchuk Y.F., Bajgonakova G.A., Gunter S.V., Shishelova A.A., Russ Phys J, 63, (2020); Yasenchuk Y., Marchenko E., Baigonakova G., Gunther S., Kokorev O., Gunter V., Chekalkin T., Topolnitskiy E., Obrosov A., Kang J., Biomed Mater, 16, (2021); Monogenov A.N., Gunther V.E., Anikeev S.G., Marchenko E.S., Khodorenko V.N., Fatyushin M.Y., Russ Metall, 10, (2020); Luo R.K., Wu X., Mortel W.J., Mullins effect modelling and experiment for anti-vibration systems, Polym Test, 40, pp. 304-312, (2014); Yasenchuk Y.F., Marchenko E.S., Gunter S.V., Baigonakova G.A., Kokorev O.V., Volinsky A.A., Topolnitsky E.B., Materials, 14, (2021); Luo R.K., Peng L., Wu X., Mortel W.J., Polym Testing, 40, pp. 304-312, (2014); Kondratov A.P., Cherkasov E.P., Nagornova I.V., AIP Conf Proc, 2141, (2019); Hu J., Zhu Y., Huang H., Lu J., Prog Polymer Sci, 37, (2012); Kondratov A.P., Volinsky A.A., Chen J., Polymer Technol, 37, (2018); Jiang Z.C., Xiao Y., Kang Y., Pan M., Li B.-J., Zhang S., Appl A.C.S., Mater Interfaces, 9, 24, (2017); Kondratov A.P., Volinsky A.A., Chen J., J Appl Polym Sci, 133, (2016); Zare M.T., Prabhakaran M.P., Parvin N., Ramakrishna S., Chem Eng J, 374, (2019); Rubinstein M., Panyukov S., Macromolecules, 35, pp. 6670-6686, (2002); Estevez R., Tijssens M.G.A., Giessen E., J Mech Phys Solids, 48, pp. 2585-2617, (2000); Rakkapao N., Vao-Soongnern V., J Polym Res, 21, (2014); Gao C., Lu H., Ni H., Chen J., J Polym Res, 25, 1, (2018); Juan L., J Nanomater, 5, (2017)","A.A.

It investigated if the CBDC had the potential to improve the efficiency and lending power of the financial system. The research relied on secondary data from a range of financial markets, such as the FTSE, MSCI, Gold Index, S&P 500, and Dow Jones, collected during the COVID-19 period. The quantitative approach was employed using the statistical software SPSS to perform descriptive statistics and regression analysis. The results revealed that the financial markets were negatively impacted by COVID-19, but the CBDC saw a higher level of development during the same period. The statistical analysis showed a positive and significant relationship between the CBDC Attention Index, the Uncertainty Index, and various financial market indices, with regression analysis indicating a significant impact of the CBDC Attention Index on all financial market indices except the Gold Index. However, this study has some limitations, including its limited scope of financial markets. Despite this, these results have important implications for academics and policymakers. It is recommended to increase the use of CBDC through well-crafted policies and legislation to fully realize its potential impact on the financial system. © 2023 by the authors.

The most wide-spread technique in this regard is the high-pressure water jet slotting. Efficiency of rock cutting by a thin water jet is governed by the factor of slot depth. The hydraulic cuttability is represented by the hardness ratio and the temporal crushing strain of coal and rocks. It is possible to enhance the damaging capability of the high-pressure water jets by adding them with abrasive materials. The basic patterns and rational parameters of hydraulic and hydroabrasive rock cutting are found. The mathematical models of the cutting processes are constructed. The proposed design of a hydroabrasive cutting tool has a water channel of variable geometry to ensure the maximal damaging capability of hydroabrasive water jets and to make the tool adaptable to different secondary operations eventual in mining and construction. The hydroabrasive water jet cutting tool has successfully passed the lab-scale and full-scale testing. © 2023 Publishing house Mining book.

Terminological work, both in the world and in Russian science, was carried out, first of all, on the material of exact and technical disciplines. Arrangement of terminology of humanitarian knowledge has been in the focus of attention of researchers only in recent years. Thus, the aim of the work is to study the terminological system of historical knowledge by means of parametric analysis of the little-known course by V.O. Klyuchevsky “Terminology of Russian History”, which was first published in 1956 and practically was not studied by either historians or linguists, and this substantiates the novelty of the present work. Materials and Methods. The material of this course, studied with the help of historical-comparative, historical-typological, as well as general scientific methods such as analysis and synthesis, using parametric analysis and positional statistics, showed that the terminology proposed by V.O. Kluchevsky has a systemic nature and its structure is hierarchical. Nine parameters – archaeological, geographical, terminological, illustrative, source study, classifi cation, chronological, economic, etymological – were singled out in the work. A conditional notion of the place of each parameter in the so-called “dictionary article”, which is determined by the boundary of the two parameters, was introduced. The notion of a “dictionary article” as applied to the course materials is conditional, since the course is not a dictionary proper. Analysis. Using statistical methods, the frequency of occurrence of each parameter in a certain place in each of the three parts of the course is identified. Statistical tables are formed, which make it possible to see the similarity and difference between the three parts of the course and to point out their features. This article traces not only the scientist’s fluency in ancient and modern languages, including rare ones, but also the ability to use linguistic techniques, such as historical-etymological and word-formation analysis, on the material of the “Terminology of Russian History.” Results. The semantic invariant in the construction of the parts of the course has been revealed. This is an additional evidence of the systematic nature of the historical terminology, which was suggested by V.O. Klyuchevsky. The hierarchical nature of the system of terms, created in the course by V.O. Klyuchevsky, has been determined. Contribution of the authors.

The goal of the study is to determine priority directions in state regulation aimed at ensuring the sustainable territorial development of Russia. The quality of state regulation is considered in the study as a crucial factor in the sustainability of regional development. Methodology: For this purpose, the use of the mechanisms of state management of territorial sustainable development in Russia and other states is compared and the absence or presence of certain mechanisms in Russian practice is noted. The main research methods were comparative method and survey study. Results: The paper reported the results of the analysis of the realization of state policy in ensuring the sustainable development of Russian territories. The authors examined positive international experience in the state regulation of regional development and studied its directions and the features of institutional interaction. The paper explored various components of a comprehensive mechanism for managing the sustainable development of Russian territories. Contribution: The suggested priority directions for state regulation of territorial sustainable development are strategic planning, the formation of a single management and monitoring center, the organization of management along the line center – regions – territories, as well as interregional interaction, and the development and use of integral indicators for assessing the achievement of sustainable development goals. © 2023, Centro Universitario Curitiba - UNICURITIBA.

The purpose of the article is to describe the use of the hypothesis of linear damage summation when processing the results of fatigue tests. In the study, the authors used empirical methods such as indirect observation of the object under study, description, and measurement of technical influences exerted on it by an artificial means. The linear regression analysis to establish the relationship between stress and durability was also used. The endurance limit of the titanium alloy was determined, which lies in the range from 460 to 480 MPa with the number of cycles from 105 to 108. It was concluded that the use of the linear damage summation hypothesis in processing the results of fatigue tests entails a satisfactory practical accuracy of the calculation of endurance limit. © 2023 Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico.

The floating layers were modeled and the geometric characteristics of molecular packings on water surface were calculated. It was shown that the area per molecule in the dense face-on packing of a monolayer is 1.69 nm2, and in the edge-on packing – 0.90 nm2. Analysis of the floating layer compression isotherm revealed that ZnTPP molecules are arranged face-on to the interface plane. Electron absorption spectroscopy showed that LS-films contain aggregates of J-type. The surface morphology of LS-films studied by AFM revealed that the average roughness of LS-films increases by 1.4 times with an increase in the number of transfers from one to five. The sensing properties of the LS-films (with 15 transfers) with respect to hydroxypyridine and pyridine in aqueous and gaseous media, correspondingly, have been studied. It was established that the LS-film is sensitive to pyridine vapors. The results obtained can be used to create selective sensors for environmental pollution monitoring. © Maltсeva O. V., Nikitin K.

The aim of the work is to determine the influence of the structure of the filter materials formed as a result of modification of the surface layer on their water permeability and the size of trapped solid particles. Materials and methods. The non-woven fabrics from a mixture of polyethylene-terephthalate (PET) (70 wt.%) and bicomponent fibers (BCF) of the core-shell structure were used as objects of the study. The non-woven fabrics were obtained by mechanically forming the canvas with its subsequent hardening by needle punching. The resulting materials were modified by heat treatment. The water transfer in the modified materials was determined by the permeability coefficient. The filtration efficiency was determined by the number of trapped particles of a certain size. Results and discussion. The needle-punched non-woven fabrics without additional heat treatment are not suitable for water filtration. The proposed method of thermal and deformation-thermal modification provides the production of gradient materials with a controlled thickness of the nanoscale surface layer. Although a decrease in water permeability is observed, the modified material traps solid particles with a smaller (compared to unmodified ~ 20 µm) equivalent diameter of 2–4 µm, which is sufficient to prepare water for use in steam generators and in the production of building materials. Conclusion. The optimal parameters of deformation-heat treatment for obtaining the high-effective filtration non-woven materials were established: the temperature – 180оC, the processing speed – 3.5 m/min. © Nazarov V.G., Ivanov L.A., Dedov A.V., Bokova E.S., Statnik E.S., 2023.","filter nanolayer; heat treatment; needle-punched non-woven fabric; water filtration","","","","","","","","Patanaik A., Anandjiwala R., Some Studies on Water Permeability of Nonwoven Fabrics, Textile Research J, 79, 2, pp. 147-152, (2009); Ozen I., Multi-layered breathable fabric structures with enhanced water resistance, J.

The tasks are formulated to achieve the goal. They involve classifying the methods of foreign language teaching based on the competency approach and identifying the effective methods. The methodological basis of this research includes methods of analyzing the practical experience of foreign language teaching based on a competency-based approach, synthesis of national and international experience, comparison of national models of the language environment, and generalization of sociological data. As a result of the conducted research, it has been revealed that among various methods, approaches related to information and communication technologies [ICT] are utilized most often. We believe that when teachers conduct courses using synchronous computer-mediated communication [SCMC] tools or platforms, students should be given opportunities to express their opinions. Most teachers recognize the creation of instructional videos as the most effective. According to the students, this type of activity also has the greatest learning effect and stimulates creativity. The scientific novelty of the research is the study of foreign language teaching methods based on a competency-based approach within the framework of online distance learning and the relationship of all interested parties, in other words, teachers, students, and educational institutions.

The metric is admissible for any angular momentum of the disk. As demonstrated in the present paper the parameter determining the angular momentum of the Milky Way greatly exceeds its gravitational radius so that the Kerr metric physically admissible only if the angular momentum is sufficiently small is completely inapplicable to the Milky Way. It is shown on the basis of the new metric that the rotation of the Milky Way plays a decisive role in the motion of satellites in its gravitational field.

The effects of CeO2 addition on the crystal structure and high-temperature conductivity of the crystals have been investigated. According to X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy, it was found that Ce cations in crystals are present mainly as Ce4+ ions. The study of the grown crystals by X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy showed that all the grown crystals were single-phase and had either a tetragonal t`` or cubic structure, the latter having crystals containing 10 mol% Y2O3 and doped with CeO2. Doping of the crystals with CeO2 was accompanied by a linear increase in the lattice parameter. This indicates the entry of CeO2 into the crystal lattice with the formation of a solid solution. The study of the ionic conductivity of crystals by impedance spectroscopy in the temperature range 400–900 °C showed that the substitution of Zr4+ ions with Ce4+ ions manifests itself in different ways and can either increase or decrease the value of high-temperature conductivity depending on the content of stabilizing yttrium oxide. Possible reasons for this behavior are discussed. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Conductivity; Single crystal; SOFC; Structure; Zirconia","Cerium oxide; Doping (additives); High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Ions; Single crystals; Solid solutions; X ray absorption; Yttria stabilized zirconia; Yttrium oxide; Conductivity; Crystals structures; Electrolytics; Grown crystals; High temperature conductivity; Melting techniques; Property; Skull melting; Solid solution crystals; Yttria-stabilized-zirconia; Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC)","","","","","European Union's Horizon 2020 Framework Program H2020-WIDESPREAD-01-2016-2017-TeamingPhase2, (739508); Moscow Polytechnic University; VINNOVA, (2018-04969); Svenska Forskningsrådet Formas, (2019-02496); Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation, Minobrnauka, (GK 075-15-2021-696); Vetenskapsrådet, VR, (2018-07152); Latvijas Universitate; Institute of Solid State Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, ISSP","Funding text 1: The structure was investigated using the equipment of the center for collective use of scientific equipment “Material Science and Metallurgy,” purchased with the financial support of the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation (GK 075-15-2021-696).

The problem of recovery potential of the mining industries–former flagships in the mineral sector is discussed. The aim of the research is to justify the expediency of metal leaching from the substandard metal-bearing raw materials. The research uses the methods of generalization and systematization of the experience gained in metal leaching from ore and tailings, the analysis of the leaching technologies and prediction of their applicability in a specific region. The results of reform and development strategy in the region are described. It is shown that the modern ore processing technologies are unprofitable in case of raw materials with substandard content of metals. The feasibility of profitable mineral extraction by chemical oxidation and transition of metals to readily soluble compounds is validated. The figures of the advanced technology-based recovery of metals from industrial effluents in blocks and in disintegrator are given. The mixed-type technology is proposed for mineral production including high-grade ore processing on a plant scale and metal leaching from low-grade ore and from tailings in activators. The technologies of metal leaching from substandard ore and processing tailings are yet a dead area in recovery of lost potential of mining companies in the Northern Caucasus. The specifics of metal leaching from hard sulfide-bearing ore of the region and the features of the regional mineral deposits are found. The application conditions are refined for each type of leaching. © 2023 Publishing house Mining book.

The presence of IRD is associated with a high risk of disease and severe course of COVID-19 during immunosuppressive treatment, primarily anti-B cell therapy with rituximab (RTX), and a low level of post-vaccination response in such patients. A new strategy for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 are virus-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to coronavirus; currently, combined long-acting monoclonal antibodies tixagevimab and cilgavimab (Evusheld) are registered for prevention in the world and the Russian Federation. . Tixagevimab and cilgavimab (TC) show neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2, including the Omicron strain, primarily its variants BA.4, BA.5, BA.2.75 (""Centaur""). Objective – to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TC for pre-exposure prophylaxis of COVID-19 in rheumatic patients receiving RTX, based on a prospective observational study. Materials and methods. The main group included 86 patients with various IMRD receiving RTX: 50 of them had ANCA-associated systemic vasculitis (AAV), 15 – rheumatoid arthritis, 9 – Sjogren’s syndrome (SS), 4 – IgG4-related disease, 3 – systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), 3 – dermatomyositis (DM), 2 – systemic scleroderma (SSD). Median age was 59 (19–82) years; male: female ratio – 1:1,8. From March 26 to August 30 2022, patients received a single intramuscular injection of TC in a total dose of 300 mg, mainly after RTX (in 52% of cases, in 28% on the next day after RTX). The control group included 42 patients with AAV (median age – 45 (35–71) years; male: female ratio – 1:1), also treated with RTX, who did not receive pre-exposure prophylaxis of TC. The duration of observation was 7 months, until November 1 2022. At this time, 98% of confirmed cases of coronavirus in the Russian Federation were Omicron. A telephone and/or online survey of patient has been conducted to detect cases of COVID-19 and adverse reactions. Results. In the TC group, confirmed coronavirus infection have been detected in 17 (20%) patients (AAV – 10, SS – 3, SSD – 2, SLE – 1, DM – 1), with fever in 7 (8%), only in one case hospitalization was required (lung damage was not detected in computed tomography), in two cases, according to CT mild lung damage (CT 1–2), there were no deaths. Good TC’s tolerability was noted, signs not associated with COVID-19 or progression of IMRD after administration of TC were observed in 8 (9%) patients (GPA – 3 MPA – 1, RA – 2, SLE – 1, IgG4-related disease – 1), adverse reactions definitely associated with the use of TC were not found. The most serious event not associated with coronavirus infection was the progression of polyneuropathy in a patient with RA. In the control group, 3 (7%) patients were diagnosed with COVID-19, one with severe lung injury (CT 3, pulmonary embolism) and death. Conclusions. The data of clinical studies and our own clinical experience evidence the effectiveness of the use of a combination of long-acting monoclonal antibodies TC (Evusheld), registered for indications for pre-exposure prophylaxis and treatment of COVID-19. Patients with IMRD treated with RTX have a favorable safety profile of TC. The introduction of virus-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, a new drug class for the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases, opens significant prospects for improving the prognosis of patients with IRD. © 2023 Ima-Press Publishing House.

The object of the study is the method of teaching written translation to economics students. The subject of the research is testing the efficiency of the method for teaching written translation of business correspondence to economics students in the framework of English as a foreign language. The goal of the study is to develop a model for teaching written translation of business correspondence and to substantiate its use in the training of economics students. The authors propose and experimentally test a method of teaching the translation of English-language business correspondence. The research methodology involved a pedagogical experiment conducted in several stages with four experimental groups (120 students). The experiment included the selection of suitable educational materials, the development of a set of exercises, and criteria for evaluating WTBC skill formation. The efficiency of two teaching variants, Variant A and Variant B, was compared. The results obtained evidence that the use of appropriately selected educational material and a set of exercises developed on its basis ensure the high quality of the written translation of business correspondence by students. Furthermore, the variant of performing special exercises to improve translation skills in all types of business correspondence at the end of each learning cycle improves learning outcomes. © 2023 by Cherkas Global University All rights reserved","business correspondence;

A calibration graph of the dependence of hardness on the amount of deformation for steel 20 GOST 1050-2013 has been built, thereby obtaining the possibility of predicting the properties of parts obtained by cold forging. Production is currently carried out by outdated methods, using labor-intensive technology on metal-cutting equipment with preforming and with a large scrap metal. The part ""hub"" for the car clutch disc is made from two blanks (boss and flange) by permanent joining, which is obtained by cold forging with subsequent machining. To determine the dependence of hardness on the deformation intensity and stress intensity and to construct a calibration graph, experiments were carried out on the compression of samples from the researched metal. Due to good lubrication at the ends of the sample (periodically replaced polyethylene gaskets in combination with machine oil), the stress state can be considered linear. Stress state index K = 0.33. Lode-Nadai index μσ = 1. Also, to reduce the barrel-shaped according to height of the samples, the ratio of the initial sizes is within the following limits 2 ≥ h0 / d0 ≥ 1. Steel 20 was chosen for the research. Hot-rolled round steel bar according to was used as blanks. In the value of the accumulated deformation from e = 0.4 to 0.5, steel 20 corresponds to the hardness of steel 35 in the initial state, this makes it possible to reasonably replace the metal for forming parts. © 2023, Ore and Metals Publishing house.

For this purpose, screw rolling with incomplete firmware of 1000 pcs was carried out at a temperature of 1160 °C vessels made of 50 steel on a three-roll screw mill TPA 30-80, which is part of the rolling and pressing line (RPL) of the machine-building enterprise BF JSC NPO Pribor. It has been experimentally established that the temperature of the initial bar-billet during the formation of the closed cavity of the semi-finished product affects the heating of the plug parts: the nose is at least 600 °C, the tail is about 350 °C, as a result of which a ferrite ring with a height of about 0.6 mm is formed on the plug surface. Subsequent cooling of the plug with water for 2 seconds. up to a temperature of about 100 °C reduces the time of temperature exposure in the release cycle of vessels on the PPL. The results of changes in grain size and hardness at the stages of production every 100 pcs are presented. vessels along the length of the plug. A scheme for the production of semi-finished vessels made of steel 50 is proposed, which reduces the contact time with a rotating mandrel by 20 %. Reducing the immersion time of the mandrel during the formation of the vessel cavity led to a two-fold increase in its service life. © 2023, Ore and Metals Publishing house.

It is especially difficult to predict dynamic loads resulting from the unau-thorized activities of third parties. Such incidents can interfere with the functioning of structures, lead to their destruction and, as a result, to catastrophic consequences for the economy, the environment, and the population. The results are considered related to the experimental studies of the penetrating action of small arms bullets into various materials. The studies were conducted for verifying the reliability of the results of a theoretical assessment of the penetrating effect of bullets. The possibility was considered related to the manufacturing protective screens in the field conditions, which guarantees non-penetration of critical elements of hydraulic structures by a bullet. As the main striking element, a bullet of a rifle cartridge 7,62×54R is considered. Experimental studies included a series of experiments with different targets. The number of shots on one target did not exceed 27, while the absence of through holes made it possible to speak of a 90 % confidence probability of non-penetration of the tested protective structure. Results of the experimental study showed that to ensure impenetrability, it is sufficient to use steel 2–3 mm thick, wood (pine) 18 mm or 250 mm of sand. In theoretical calculations, these values are obtained by 20–25 % more. Perhaps such discrepancies are due to the fact that the indenter in the model is represented by an absolutely solid body, while the bullets with a deformable steel core were used in the experiments. The algorithm proposed by the authors allows to choose a rational composition of the protective structure. © 2023, STC Industrial Safety CJSC.

In view of the energy intensity of the process flow at the test concentration factory, its power delivery system needs an improvement. One of the methods of making decisions on power delivery more effective is planning. The effectiveness of planning requires inclusion and comprehensive analysis of all production factors. The energy consumption forecast enables a systemic control of power intake at the factory, with the real-time inclusion of all data on a production process. For this reason, it seems to be scientifically relevant to develop and adapt energy consumption prediction techniques. The scope of this study also embraces the modern methods of the intelligent analysis of data. Using the actual data on daily energy consumption in 2021, a number of the machine learning models are constructed and their accuracy is compared. The best prediction is provided by the model using the Random Forest algorithm. The error of the forecast for a week ahead is less than 5% MAPE, which allows considering the obtained result as an accurate outcome. © 2023 Publishing house Mining book.

In this case, the structure operates in a pulsed mode, which is actually based on the introduction of temporal redundancy when building a self-checking device. This, unfortunately, leads to some decrease in performance, however, it significantly improves the characteristics of controllability, which is especially important for devices and systems of critical use, the input data for which does not change so often. A brief review of methods for constructing built-in control circuits based on the self-duality property of calculated functions is given. The basic structures of the organization of built-in control circuits are given. The proposed ways of developing the theory of synthesis of built-in control circuits are based on checking whether or not the calculated functions belong to a class of self-dual Boolean functions. All possible values of the number of data bits for Hamming codes have been established. They will have the property of the self-duality of functions describing control bits. En-coders of such Hamming codes will be self-dual devices. Since the functions of the check bits of Hamming codes are linear, in order for them to be self-dual, it is necessary that an odd number of arguments be used in each of them. It is proved that the number of bits of code words of Hamming codes with self-dual check functions is equal to n=3+4l, l∈N0. The results of the simulations self-dual devices with built-in control circuits along two diagnostic parameters in the Multisim environment are presented. A method is proposed for modification of the structure of calculation control along two diagnostic parameters, which allows to use any linear block code (not necessarily Hamming code). It is based on retrofitting the encoder with a device for converting functions into self-dual ones. In fact, this is a code modification device. It is proved that to obtain a modified Hamming code with self-dual control functions for n=3+4l, l∈N0; cases, it is enough to add modulo M=2 the non-self-dual control function with the function of the high data bit. © 2023 St. Petersburg Federal Research Center of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

Study Design: Experimental research design. Place and Duration of Study: The study was conducted in a secondary school in Russia within 4 months. Material and Methods: 141 schoolchildren, aged 15-16, who studied in the 9th grade, took part in the experiment. The main research method was the “Trondyke Test”, which determines the level of attention development of schoolchildren. The test was used before and after the physical education lesson 1 time per month for 5 months. the reliability of the increase in indicators was determined by the Student's T-criterion (p>0.05). Results: children who did not engage in physical education in the lesson were not able to significantly improve their performance in the test, which indicates a possible adaptation to the test after its first performance before the lesson. Children who were engaged in physical exercises were able to significantly increase the test results. Conclusion: the results obtained determine the effectiveness of the influence of a physical education lesson at school on the indicators of children's attention. This study will serve as an additional motivation for children to engage in physical culture, since the impact of physical exercises has a positive effect not only on the development of physical qualities, but also on the attention of schoolchildren. © 2023, Pakistan Pediatric Journal.

Methods: Quasi-exoerimental study with intervention group (n = 52) and control group (n = 52), whose sample considered children belonging to ordinary school number 60 of the Russian Federation. The experimental group was subjected to classic exercises adapted from the game ""Hopscotch"", while the control group was applied the standard school physical culture program at school. The ability to feel the rhythm of the movements was assessed by the ""Running in rhythm"" test, while for the statistical analysis the Student's T test was applied considering p=0,05. Results: After the end of the pedagogical experiment, the indicators of children in the control group improved by 2.8% (p>0,05; d =0,3). The indicators of children in the experimental group improved by 24.7% (p<0,05; d=2,7). Such results can be explained by the effectiveness of the implementation of a set of exercises using a standard classics exercise in physical education lessons at school. Conclusion: The indicators of the sense of the rhythm of movements will significantly improve if children aged 8-9 will additionally perform a set of physical exercises on standard classics exercise during physical education lessons at school. © Copyright: Federación Española de Asociaciones de Docentes de Educación Física (FEADEF)","Child; Motor Skills; Physical Education and Training","","","","","","","","Arseniev D.G., Bondarchuk I.

The aim of the research is to study the compressibility of composite materials obtained by varying the degree of impregnation of a non-woven needle-punched cloth with an aqueous dispersion of polyurethane. Materials and research methods. Non-woven needle-punched cloth made of polyethylene terephthalate fibers (TU 6-13-0204077-95-91) with a linear density of 0.33 tex (diameter 20–25 microns) was used as objects of research. For impregnation, an aqueous dispersion of anionic stabilized aliphatic polyethiruretane of the brand IMPRANIL DL 1380 (PRC) with a dry residue of 40% was used. The compressibility of canvases and composite materials was established using the ICH indicator according to GOST 577-68 with an accuracy of mea-suring the thickness of ± 0.001 mm. Results and discussion. An approach is proposed to establish the relationship between the degree of compressibility of composite materials and the load and to obtain an equation for predicting the degree of compressibility of composite materials from the degree of impregnation and load. Optimal loading conditions of the composite material with a minimum degree of compressibility has been established. Conclusion. The optimal degree of impregnation of a non-woven needle-punched fabric made of polyethylene terephthalate fibers with a diameter of 20–25 microns with polyurethane dispersion is 0.5. © Nazarov V.G., Dedov A.V., Bokova E.S., 2023.","composite material; compressibility; impregnation; non-woven needle-punched cloth; polyurethane dispersion","","","","","","","","Dubrovski P.

The perspective of a decrease in the content of lanthanum from 2 to 0.5 wt % in new alloys has been validated using advanced methods for analyzing the structure and phase composition (electron microscopy, X-ray phase analysis, thermodynamic calculation) and using the analysis of mechanical (tensile) properties formed in the course of deformation treatment. The evolution of the structure of the alloys was studied in the course of thermodeformation treatment. It has been shown that upon hot rolling at 400°С with no preliminary annealing of ingots it is possible to obtain high-quality deformed semiproducts (sheets) with no surface and edge defects (up to a 90% reduction). The deformation treatment provides the formation of a structure with inclusions of a (Al,Mn)4(Ca,La) eutectic phase uniformly distributed in an aluminum matrix and found in a form of ring-shaped precipitates of submicron sizes (300 × 150 nm). In addition, the formation of a net of low-angle boundaries (subgrains) with a mean size of ~1 μm is observed; some inclusions of a eutectic phase are found along these boundaries. This combination of structural characteristics mainly determines the ability of reaching favorable mechanical properties of an alloy after hot rolling with 0.5 wt % La (the ultimate strength of 240–260 MPa, yield strength of 185–205 MPa, and relative elongation of 5.5–9.0%), which are comparable with the properties of the previously studied alloy with up to 2 wt % La. © 2023, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","aluminum–calcium alloys; eutectic; mechanical properties; microstructure; rolled sheets; thermal treatment","Aluminum alloys; Binary alloys; Calcium alloys; Hot rolling; Lanthanum alloys; Manganese alloys; Microstructure; Structural properties; Aluminum–calcium alloy; Chemical compositions; Eutectic phase; High tech; Microstructures and mechanical properties; New alloys; Optimisations; Rolled sheets; Wrought alloys; X-ray phase analysis; Eutectics","","","","","Russian Science Foundation, RSF, (22-19-00121)","This work was supported by the Russia Science Foundation, project no. 22-19-00121, https://rscf.ru/project/22-19-00121/ .

The conducted studies show that the crushing zones were formed under conditions of intense movements with repeated renewal of their contacts, expressed in crushing and metasomatic replacement. At least two stages are established: opening and filling of cracks with quartz and quartz-carbonate mineralization in a tension setting oriented perpendicular to the walls of these cracks; vertical displacements along fractures and formation of lenticular bodies of breccia structure, in which early quartz-carbonate vein-veinlets are crushed and cemented by late veinlets of several generations of carbonates. Local anomalies of polarizability, areal anomalies of increased polarizability along the Western ore-tectonic zone, as well as low-contrast anomalies of the magnetic field in the northwestern part of the Northern zone were revealed. The correlation of the ridges with the minima of the magnetic field is observed. Studies of silver ore objects made it possible to reveal both a fundamental similarity in their composition in polymetallic ores, and significant differences, primarily explained by the composition of magmatism. © 2022 Publishing house Mining book.

The following approaches were used in the study: computational, classification, and cartographic methods, aerospace, geoinformation technologies. The research uses a five-level framework for defining “final ecosystem services”. Such framework can be applied on specific territories if transformed according to the following scheme: type of a class-class-group-division-section. This scheme allows one to specify the indicators of an ecosystem service and clarify its functions at each hierarchical level. To improve objectivity of area’s ecological integrity evaluation, as well as accuracy and completeness of input materials for further evaluation of ecosystem services, it is proposed to determine the degree of ecological stability, the level of environmental risk and the degree of anthropogenic impact as basic indicators of the studied region. The approach is applied for the territory of an average village council. The implementation of a “donor-recipient” system of interregional relations is proposed for two ecosystem services: prevention of water erosion and recreation. Using cartographicmaterials and historical archival aerospace images for desktop and field research on the assessment of ecosystem services reduces the time used for this work.

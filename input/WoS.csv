The basis for the study was a child burial from the Tovsta Mohyla mound as one of the few not robbed burials of steppe Scythia of the 4th century BC. Meanwhile, the burial is regarded as a text (in the semiotic sense). The method developed by the author for reconstructing the semantics of images on the costume elements of the buried led to the conclusion that they reflect a complex of ideas about dominion over the midzone of the mythological universe. The article rebuilds the semiotic status of things that accompanied the buried which allowed us to conclude that the child in the Scythian society inherited the place in the social space belonging to his kin. The child's burial from the Tovsta Mohyla mound belonged to the Scythian priest-king. The buried has not yet passed the initiation so the grave lacks things that are peculiar only to the male or female inventory. Prospect of further research is connected with the methodology development for reconstructing the semantics of the Scythian burial as a single complex.;[Kokorina, Yu.

The results of the study made it possible to determine the yield strength (deformation resistance), ultimate strength and relative elongation of strips of the BrOF6.5-0.15 bronze alloy after rolling with a percent reduction epsilon = 6-27%. The strips 3 mm thick, 30 mm wide, and approximately 200 mm long were used for test rolling. Based on the data obtained, hardening curves were constructed, which made it possible to establish quantitative patterns of changes in the metal deformation resistance (yield strength) sigma(T), ultimate strength sigma(B) and relative elongation delta on the deformation degree of the BrOF6.5-0.15 bronze alloy of a specific chemical composition.Regression equations for calculating and predicting changes in the main indicators of the mechanical properties of strips of the BrOF6.5-0.15 alloy during cold rolling with various reductions have been obtained. The adequacy of the equations obtained, confirmed by high correlation coefficients (R-2 > 0.9), allows recommending them for calculating the force indicators of rolling and the use in computer-aided design systems (CAD) of rational deformation modes of strips of BrOF6.5-0.15 bronze.;"[Shatalov, R.

J;Pozdnyakov, MV;;;;Pozdnyakov, Maxim V.;;;Critical thinking: Its essence and presence in the educational programs of Russian universities;TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL;;;Russian;Article;;;;;;"critical thinking; skepticism; reflective thinking; educational standards; universal competencies; consciousness manipulation; information space; logic; argumentation";;The article deals with the issue of the essence of critical thinking and its development among students of Russian universities, which has become relevant due to the fact that the Russian educational standards of higher education 3++ introduced in 2017 contain a group of universal competencies systemic and critical thinking, which did not exist before. The article aims to answer several interrelated questions: What is critical thinking (what components does it include)? How should the task of developing critical thinking be implemented in Russian higher education institutions? What should be included in the content of the academic subject that is responsible for developing critical thinking? The analysis is based on the already existing positions of Russian and foreign authors, as well as the pedagogical practice at universities of the Russian Federation of the author himself, which includes teaching logic and philosophy. When considering the points of view on the essence of critical thinking and its components, the author concludes that critical thinking includes a general skeptical attitude, logical components, metacognition, etc. The author particularly points out that these elements should be supplemented by the ability to fix in the proposed information the fact of manipulation of consciousness and the distinction of its types. This requires the knowledge of these techniques. The author infers that the necessary link within these operations is the identification of the beneficiaries of manipulation. It explains why, without this link, critical thinking cannot function in principle. The result of the article is the following conclusions. 1. Based on the modern requirements for educational standards, which contain a universal competence related to the category critical thinking, it is necessary to introduce a discipline into educational programs that teaches such thinking. 2. The position according to which this task can be solved by studying the main program in the absence of such a discipline seems unconvincing to the author. 3. Meaningful critical thinking is a complex ability, which, being a generally enhanced version of the rational, integrates a number of components. Setting and solving the task of developing students' critical thinking, the teacher needs to fix the following components as such: a skeptical position regarding the reliability of information, an attitude to the use of critical thinking (with its sub-components mentioned above), logic and theory of argumentation, metacognitive monitoring, knowledge of typical methods of manipulation of consciousness, including raising the question of its beneficiaries in specific situations, etc. 4. An academic discipline whose task is to teach critical thinking should include a number of theoretical blocks: a block on the general structure of cognitive abilities, a block of logic, a block of argumentation theory, a block on methods of manipulating consciousness, a block on ways of presenting tasks and strategies for solving them.;[Pozdnyakov, Maxim V.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Moscow, Russia;Moscow Polytechnic University;Pozdnyakov, MV (corresponding author), Moscow Polytech Univ, Moscow, Russia.;ma2017xim@gmail.com;Pozdnyakov, Maxim/GLS-3369-2022;;;;;;12;0;0;0;0;TOMSK STATE UNIV;TOMSK;LENIN AVE, 36, TOMSK, 634050, RUSSIA;1561-7793;1561-803X;;TOMSK STATE UNIV J;Tomsk State Univ.

Ageeva presents the family correspondence of the Ufa mayor A.A. Malleev and studies his biography. The epistolary finding and the specific historical context of the story introduce different as-pects of the history of urban administration and the everyday life of the provincial nobility in the late 19th - early 20th centuries. The book has become an original contribution to regional historiography, and its author has revised some of the conclusions of his predecessors, based on a metahistorical narrative. Information about the origin and genea-logical relations of the family surname sheds light on the formation of the official elite in the eastern provinces as a result of the industrial development of the region in the 18th century and the reforms of local government and the court system in the post-reform period. The epistolary material recreates a portrait of personal qualities of the mod-ernizers and testifies to the formation of new personnel in the provinces - the carriers of a genuine democratic cul-ture. The author analyzes the influence of ethical views of officials on managerial decision-making as a central prob- lem poorly developed in institutional history. The author traced it on the example of the events of the 1905 revolu-tionary crisis in Ufa. The discourse of private correspondence contains a lot of valuable evidence on the family life of the Malleevs, their religious identity and methods of raising children, on cultural and everyday life of the urban elite of a provincial town. The style and spelling of the letters, as well as the turns of phrase and the accepted spelling of certain words at that time, have remained unchanged, which increases the value of the source. The literal capture of the smallest details of everyday history make the book a practical tool for museum workers, fashion historians and other professionals.;[Azamatova, G.

It was determined that the parameters of hatching mode affect the roughness of the lateral surface when building samples with vertical walls. It was shown that the average height of surface roughness, Rz, increases as the energy of hatching mode is intensified. A physical model was proposed to describe the effect of parameters of hatching mode on the roughness of vertical walls, which is based on the hypothesis that a melt microflow can penetrate during hatching onto the external surface of the contour. It was demonstrated that the distribution of surface roughness values of vertical walls is non-Gaussian, and the curves are typically right-skewed (the mode is located to the left of the center of size grouping), which indicates the influence of non-random factors whose number or values systematically change over time.;"[Krasnova, E.

The following tasks were carried out: mathematical mod-eling of thermohydraulic processes in different slot channels having constant height along them (from 0.3 mm to 0.5 mm); analysis of the influence of the slit channels' height, the number of distancing el-ements in rows, the distance between rows and the total number of elements on the average value of the Nusselt number and on the pressure drop; analysis of the effect of changes in speed and tempera-ture conditions on thermal and hydraulic characteristics. The most important results are the following facts: the influence of the relative location of the distancing elements on the thermohydraulic charac-teristics of the flow is negligible; changes in the temperature and speed regime of the laminar flow practically does not affect the intensity of convection in the matrix channels; an increase in the height of the slot channel leads to a relatively small decrease in the average value of the Nusselt number. The significance of the results obtained is that they can be the basis for adjusting the methods of de-sign calculations of rotary heat exchangers taking into account the decrease in thermal efficiency caused by the presence of distancing elements in the channels of their matrices.

This issue is often brought up by psychologists, who directly point to the leading role of the media in the forma-tion of such representations in present-day time. The author points out the kinship of research in the field of paranormal psychology with the studies of induced phenomena by Vladimir Bekhterev, who directly pointed out the role of mass media in the formation of induced ideas. The empirical part of the work consists in the analysis of a sample of media reports on the presence of ghosts, catalogued by the author. The main research question is how the features of the localization of the ghost phenomenon stated in the media can provoke its representation. The author concludes that the media are not only conductors of paranormal ideas, as noted by other researchers, but also partially demonstrate the causal relationships underlying the formation of para-normal ideas. The author underlines the close connection between a particular location, its history and the very report of paranormal phenomena in it. The author identifies the main descriptive tech-niques of the media associated with paranormal ideas, as well as shows the specifics of their distribu-tion in the media environment. In fact, the article is intended to fill a kind of information vacuum, which has formed in the studies of ideas about the paranormal both in the Russian and foreign scien-tific environment, which makes this study very relevant.;[van Haaske, Lejonis Aanris] Moscow Polytech Univ, Moscow, Russia;Moscow Polytechnic University;van Haaske, LA (corresponding author), Moscow Polytech Univ, Moscow, Russia.;mail@vanhaaske.ru;;;;;;;37;0;0;0;0;LTD CO SCIENTIFIC INDUSTRIAL ENTERPRISE GENESIS FRONTIER SCIENCE;ASTRAKHAN;UL SAVUSHKINA D 24, KV 88, ASTRAKHAN, OBLAST, RUSSIA;;2658-7734;;GALACTICA MEDIA;Galactica Media-J.

A.;;;Is the Electron Magnetic Moment Unique?;FOUNDATIONS OF PHYSICS;;;English;Article;;;;;;"Electron magnetic moment; Quantum electrodynamics; Dirac equation; Vector potential";;There exist two methods for finding the magnetic moment of the electron. The first method employed in quantum electrodynamics consists in calculating the energy of the electron placed in a constant magnetic field, the extra energy due to the field being proportional to the magnetic moment. It is also possible to use the second method proceeding from the fact that the asymptotic form of the vector potential at infinity is proportional to the magnetic moment. If the electron were point-like, both the methods would yield identical results. In the present paper is studied the magnetic field created by the electron in hydrogen-like ions, which enables one to find the electron magnetic moment by the second method. The electron magnetic moment in this case proves to be different in different states of the electron in the Coulomb field of the ions and, moreover, is distinct from the magnetic moment calculated by the first method. The results of the paper show that the electron is not small and is deformable under action of external fields.;[Golovko, V.

To substantiate and develop a program of physical and health promotion activities for students with different health levels. Materials and methods. The study involved 64 female students, ages 19-21, from the main medical group. In the experimental group, health promotion activities included health-enhancing aerobic exercises. The following research methods were used: literature review, pedagogical testing, anthropometrical measurements, functional tests and related indicators, pedagogical experiment, and mathematical statistics. Results. Two programs of health-enhancing aerobic exercises were developed with respect to the health levels and motor abilities of students. Our nine-month program included two 90-minute classes per week. The main feature of the program was the integration of two programs into a single training module, Health-enhancing aerobic exercises. The first program contributed to the improvement of morphological indicators in female students, including circumference measurements (waist by 8.2 %, shoulders by 9.2 %, hips by 6.3 %, buttocks by 5.3 %). After the first semester, 34.5 % of female students improved their physical fitness and entered a new functional group with more intense aerobic exercise. Conclusions. The study shows that our complex two-level system of health-enhancing aerobic exercises resulted in the development of various morphofunctional parameters. A significant increase was recorded for such parameters as flexibility (82 %), speed and strength (28 %), and dynamic strength (22 %). The proposed program allowed female students with different health levels to unite while differentiating their physical activities and individualizing the approach to each student.;"[Makarova, E.

As an official of the Ministry of State Property, in the 1880s, Sluchevsky accompanied the commander of the St. Petersburg Military District, Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich, on his inspection trips to the European north of Russia, its western and Baltic provinces. Sluchevsky's duties included the compilation of reports on the Grand Duke's journey, recording in them of almost every step of the high-ranking traveler and their further publication in periodicals. Despite the official nature of the publications, the materials prepared by Sluchevsky were artistic and documentary essays reflecting the life, customs and traditions of the local population, the development of industry and crafts, climatic and geographical features, history, hydrography and geology of the northwest of Russia. The article analyzes the thematic, genre and structural features of Sluchevsky's essays. The features of his texts are: dynamic storytelling, entertaining presentation, emotionality, a pronounced presence effect, a problematic approach to what was seen. Sluchevsky raised the issue of an inefficient use of the vast natural resources of the Russian northwest, pointed to the lack of support for national industry and local crafts from the state, paid considerable attention to the national question in the Baltic provinces, cited facts of discrimination of the local Orthodox Russian-speaking population by the German administration of the region. Sluchevsky's views on the problems of the Russian northwest were close to those of the influential conservative journalist Mikhail Katkov, the publisher-editor of Moscovskie Vedomosti, which contributed to Sluchevsky's publishing his essays in the newspaper. In conclusion, the article emphasizes that these essays are still of undoubted interest from a geographical, ethnographic and cultural point of view, and can serve as a valuable source of information for researchers of the history of the northwestern region.;[Perevalova, Elena V.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Journalism & Mass Commun Dept, Moscow, Russia;Moscow Polytechnic University;Perevalova, EV (corresponding author), Moscow Polytech Univ, Journalism & Mass Commun Dept, Moscow, Russia.;helenpv@yandex.ru;;;;;;;13;0;0;1;1;TOMSK STATE UNIV;TOMSK;LENIN AVE, 36, TOMSK, 634050, RUSSIA;2306-2061;2311-3774;;TEKST KNIGA KNIGOIZD;Tekst Kniga Knigoizd.;AUG;2023;32;;;;;;82;97;;10.17223/23062061/32/5;http://dx.doi.org/10.17223/23062061/32/5;;;16;Humanities, Multidisciplinary;Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI);Arts & Humanities - Other Topics;R4BS8;;;;;2024-04-12;WOS:001063823500005;View Full Record in Web of Science

The results of tensile testing of the samples of such strips are presented, which made it possible to determine the deformation resistance (yield strength), ultimate tensile strength, and percent elongation before and after rolling with a percent reduction of the cross-section area of & epsilon; = 10-30%. Based on the obtained data, curves were constructed that allowed us to establish quantitative trends in the variations of metal deformation resistance (yield strength) (& sigma;(s)), ultimate tensile strength (& sigma;(t)), and percent elongation (& delta;) depending on the degree of deformation of copper M0. It is shown that the ultimate tensile strength (& sigma;(t)) and yield strength & sigma;(0.2) (& sigma;(s)) increase with different intensity as the percent reduction increases. The & sigma;(t) parameter demonstrates a slow linear monotonic increase from 221 to 315 MPa as the percent reduction changes from 0 to 30%; while & sigma;(0.2) (& sigma;(s)) increases intensively according to the parabolic law from 41 to 308 MPa. The ductility index decreases from 63 to 16% within this deformation range. Regression equations have been obtained for calculating the basic mechanical properties of copper M0 during the process of cold rolling at various reductions. The adequacy of the obtained equations, confirmed by high correlation coefficient values (R-2 > 0.9), makes it possible to recommend them for calculating the power characteristics of the rolling process, as well as for use in the automated design (CAD) systems to determine the rational copper strips (M0) deformation conditions at the industrial sheet rolling mills.";"[Shatalov, R.

Schoolchildren in the control group were engaged in a standard physical education program at school, and children from the experimental group additionally performed burpee exercises. Endurance indicators were determined by the test running a distance of 2 kilometers (Running 2 km). The Bourdon test determined indicators of concentration of attention in children. The study used the T-criterion tests. During the study period, the level of endurance development improved by only 1.9% (p>0.05), and the concentration indicators improved from 72.2 +/- 5.8 to 75.5 +/- 6.1 (p>0.05). A slight increase in the indicators in both tests in the control group can be explained by the natural increase in the indicators of schoolchildren over four months and the effectiveness of using the standard physical education program at school.

The question arises about the neces-sity of applying a new direction in global science - imagology - for such research. The novelty of this study lies in being the first to examine material from a publication that has not attracted much attention from Rus-sian scholars from the perspective of this field. The relevance of the study is determined by the need to uncover a new perspective in studying the British press during wartime. The contexts of mentions about the Battle of Stalingrad in the weekly 'British Ally' are presented. It is proven that although an ad-miring attitude towards the Soviet victories at Stalingrad slips through in some articles, the publication does not give special atten-tion to the Battle of Volga. It is shown that the newspaper emphasizes the idea of the selfless resistance of the British army against Nazi Germany in Africa and Sicily, as well as their desire to open a second front. The authors conclude that the newspaper presents these events and desires as equivalent to the strug-gle of the Soviet people, which does not find approval or desired response among the news-paper's readers (the Russian people).;"[Kaygusuz, Cumhur] Samsun Ondokuz Mays Univ, Samsun, Turkiye; [Kokorina, Yulia G.; Vagabov, Makhach M.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Moscow, Russia";Moscow Polytechnic University;Kokorina, YG (corresponding author), Moscow Polytech Univ, Moscow, Russia.;"cumhurkaygusuz@gmail.com; kokorina@inbox.ru; 9162803@mail.ru";;;;;;;28;0;0;1;1;TSENTR NAUCHNYKH & OBRAZOVATELNYKH PROEKTOV;EKATERINBURG;PR-KT KOSMONAVTOV, DOM 43, KV 57, EKATERINBURG, 620098, RUSSIA;2225-756X;2227-1295;;NAUCH DIALOG;Nauch.

I.E.Zabelin is known not only for his purely historical works, but also works in the field of archeology. Under his leadership, the richest Scythian burial mounds in southern Russia were excavated. The most famous of them is the Chertomlyk mound, which broughtreal masterpieces of Scythian and Greek art to the treasury of the Imperial Hermitage. Scientists who analyzed the activities of I.E. Zabelin as an archaeologist, were based, as a rule, on publications belonging to the pen of the scientist. This gave riseto a series of misunderstandings and false accusations against the great Russian historian. The authors of this article used archival materials, manuscripts and field diaries of I.E. Zabelin, which allowed to debunk a number of biases that have become a kind of scientific myths. I.E. Zabelin appears as an attentive, thorough and observant archaeologist who developed his own, innovative methods of excavation and fixation of layers, as evidenced by the plans and sections of the mounds made by him. The historian independently analyzed the materials of the expeditions, studied the works of ancient authors, carried out thorough measurements and compiled detailed descriptions of monuments and artifacts. Since extracts from ancient authors are dotted with remarks of a purely linguistic nature, and the inventories of finds contain multi-page copies of ancient Greek amphoric stamps, tombstones, inscriptions on vessels, the authors of this article question the thesis of I.E. Zabelin's ignorance of the Greek language. Assessment at the modern scientific level of the contribution of I.E.

The significant dependence of the nanotexture on the technique and mode of modification is demonstrated using the original approaches to the quantitative characterization of the experimental samples' surfaces' scanning electron microscopy-images (formed with the scanning electron microscope). It is shown that the surface fluorination not only makes possible to significantly compensate for the increase of the friction coefficient of bulk-modified UHMWPE in comparison with the original one but also provides a nonlinear multiplicative increase in the wear resistance.;"[Doronin, Fedor A.; Rytikov, Georgy O.; Evdokimov, Andrey G.; Ruduak, Yury, V; Nazarov, Victor G.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Moscow, Russia; [Rytikov, Georgy O.] State Univ Management, Moscow, Russia; [Doronin, Fedor A.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Bolshaya Semenovskaya str 38, Moscow 107023, Russia";"Moscow Polytechnic University; State University of Management; Moscow Polytechnic University";Doronin, FA (corresponding author), Moscow Polytech Univ, Bolshaya Semenovskaya str 38, Moscow 107023, Russia.;f.a.doronin@mospolytech.ru;"Doronin, Fedor Alexandrovich/B-2266-2014; Nazarov, Victor/B-2274-2014; Rytikov, George/J-7097-2014";"Doronin, Fedor Alexandrovich/0000-0002-0407-060X; Rytikov, George/0000-0001-5521-8662";"Moscow Polytechnic University; Moscow Polytechnic University";"Moscow Polytechnic University; Moscow Polytechnic University";The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The reported study was funded by Moscow Polytechnic University (Grant named after V.E.

Terminological work, both in the world and in Russian science, was carried out, first of all, on the material of exact and technical disciplines. Arrangement of terminology of humanitarian knowledge has been in the focus of attention of researchers only in recent years. Thus, the aim of the work is to study the terminological system of historical knowledge by means of parametric analysis of the little-known course by V.O. Klyuchevsky Terminology of Russian History, which was first published in 1956 and practically was not studied by either historians or linguists, and this substantiates the novelty of the present work. Materials and Methods. The material of this course, studied with the help of historical-comparative, historical-typological, as well as general scientific methods such as analysis and synthesis, using parametric analysis and positional statistics, showed that the terminology proposed by V.O. Kluchevsky has a systemic nature and its structure is hierarchical. Nine parameters - archaeological, geographical, terminological, illustrative, source study, classification, chronological, economic, etymological - were singled out in the work. A conditional notion of the place of each parameter in the so-called dictionary article, which is determined by the boundary of the two parameters, was introduced. The notion of a dictionary article as applied to the course materials is conditional, since the course is not a dictionary proper. Analysis. Using statistical methods, the frequency of occurrence of each parameter in a certain place in each of the three parts of the course is identified. Statistical tables are formed, which make it possible to see the similarity and difference between the three parts of the course and to point out their features. This article traces not only the scientist's fluency in ancient and modern languages, including rare ones, but also the ability to use linguistic techniques, such as historical-etymological and word-formation analysis, on the material of the Terminology of Russian History. Results. The semantic invariant in the construction of the parts of the course has been revealed. This is an additional evidence of the systematic nature of the historical terminology, which was suggested by V.O. Klyuchevsky. The hierarchical nature of the system of terms, created in the course by V.O. Klyuchevsky, has been determined. Contribution of the authors.

Since the energy intensity of the industry remains quite high, the task of rationalizing the consumption of electricity is relevant. One of the ways to improve control accuracy when planning energy costs is to forecast electrical loads. Despite the large number of scientific papers on the topic of electricity consumption forecasting, this problem remains relevant due to the changing requirements of the wholesale electricity and power market to the accuracy of forecasts. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to support management decisions in the process of planning the volume of electricity consumption. To realize this, it is necessary to create a predictive model and determine the prospective power consumption of the power system. For this purpose, the collection and analysis of initial data, their preprocessing, selection of features, creation of models, and their optimization were carried out. The created models are based on historical data on planned power consumption, power system performance (frequency), as well as meteorological data. The research methods were: ensemble methods of machine learning (random forest, gradient boosting algorithms, such as XGBoost and CatBoost) and a long short-term memory recurrent neural network model (LSTM). The models obtained as a result of the conducted studies allow creating short-term forecasts of power consumption with a fairly high precision (for a period from one day to a week). The use of models based on gradient boosting algorithms and neural network models made it possible to obtain a forecast with an error of less than 1 %, which makes it possible to recommend the models described in the paper for use in forecasting the planned electricity power consumption of united power systems.;"[Klyuev, Roman V.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Moscow, Russia; [Morgoeva, Angelika D.; Gavrina, Oksana A.; Bosikov, Igor I.; Morgoev, Irbek D.] North Caucasian Inst Min & Met State Technol Univ, Vladikavkaz, Russia";"Moscow Polytechnic University; North Caucasian Institute of Mining & Metallurgy (State Technological University)";Morgoeva, AD (corresponding author), North Caucasian Inst Min & Met State Technol Univ, Vladikavkaz, Russia.;m.angelika-m@yandex.ru;"Morgoeva, Angelika Dzhabrailovna/CAA-1048-2022; Klyuev, Roman Vladimirovich/AAX-6549-2021; Klyuev, Roman/J-8000-2014";"Morgoeva, Angelika Dzhabrailovna/0000-0003-2949-1993; Klyuev, Roman Vladimirovich/0000-0003-3777-7203; Klyuev, Roman/0000-0003-3777-7203";;;;;36;0;0;0;0;SAINT-PETERSBURG MINING UNIV;SANKT-PETERSBURG;SAINT-PETERSBURG MINING UNIV, SANKT-PETERSBURG, 00000, RUSSIA;2411-3336;2541-9404;;J MIN INST;J.

Welding conditions were achieved via design of experiment (DOE), and the Box-Behnken design (BBD) method was selected. Welding time, welding current and electrode pressure were recorded as input parameters, while maximum displacement, peak load and failure energy of the welded samples accomplished from tensile shear tests were outputs. The influence of the welding current is superior to the influence of the welding time on the increase of the weld strength as stated by the analysis of variations (ANOVA). Relatively high welding heat input conditions enhance the mechanical attributes of the welds by increasing the nugget size. The largest mechanical properties obtained under the optimum welding conditions are welding time of 14 cycles, welding current of 10.8 kA and electrode force of 0.4 MPa. By verifying the regression models of the optimal welding conditions, the experimental results of the welded specimens with the maximum mechanical properties are about maximum displacement of 2.69 mm, peak load of 11.10 kN and failure energy of 23.90 J. The results show that the proposed spot weld strength models have an estimated accuracy of 5.32%. Due to the complete growth of austenite grains, the martensite in the coarse grain heat-affected zone (CGHAZ) is much larger than that of other zones, while in the HAZ at the side of BH steel, other phases besides martensite are also spotted, such as bainite, Widmanstatten ferrite and grain boundary ferrite. This is because BH steel has a lower carbon content.

Currently, the Programmed Pulse Pattern PWM (PPWM) technique is used extensively that allows pre-eliminating the selected harmonics from the converter's voltage and current spectrum or reducing them to meet the voltage quality standard requirements. A review of scientific publications has shown the insufficiency of available studies on defining and estimating the impact of powerful converters with PPWM. The problem of defining the amplitudes of higher harmonics generated by a converter with PPWM, which are the main cause of electronic equipment failures at the common grid connection point, is particularly relevant. This study considers the behavior of the NPC converter voltage and current spectra at PPWM with the selected harmonic elimination (SHE) for three-level (3L) voltage waveforms. The behavior of up to the 50th non-eliminated harmonics in the NPC converter voltage and current spectra is first shown for a modulation factor changing within 0-1.15 at the pitch of 0.01 for six different SHE PPWM: no. 1-5 and 7; no. 2-5, 7, 11, and 13; no. 3-5, 7, 11, 13, 17, and 19; no. 4-5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 25; no. 5-5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 25; 29, and 31; no. 6-5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 25, 29, 31, 35, and 37. The concept proposed herein allows measuring the current consumed amplitudes of NPC converter with SHE PPWM at the low average error of about 6%.

Developing the ideas of Yu.M. Lotman, who called sleep the father of semiotic processes, the researchers point out that the sacred culture, seeking to transform a person's everyday existence, warns him about the danger of exposing dreams to semiosis. From the point of view of sacred culture, everyday sleep is a lacuna in the semiotic system of the world, the message to which should be deafened, since it can carry destructive meanings. The concept of sleep is considered on the example of the drama Life is a Dream by P. Calderon and the novel Oblomov by I. Goncharov. These texts are correlated with the Leg-end of the Life of Barlaam and Joasaph by St. John of Damascus and Buddhist views on the relationship of sleep and vigil, since they were reinterpreted in accordance with the Christian cultural code in the creation of St. John of Damascus. John. The concept of sleep is correlated with the concepts of love and personality. The paper defines personality as a unique mythological code, refracted through the prism of which the general influences of the world and the semiotic system of culture are transformed into a unique essence of the I. In Buddhism, the dream of everyday life is opposed by awakening-nirvana, erasing love and personality. In Calderon's drama, overcoming the love passion for Rosaura, the main character moves from the destructive passionate dream of everyday life to the fullness of personal existence, which potentially continues to be thought of as a blessed dream. Love for a woman remains outside the sacred space of the palace-paradise. Oblomov moves away from the business fuss of profane sleep-life into an existential dream, which is a profane double of the state of holiness, with its dispassion and acquisition of a peaceful spirit, losing love for Olga, but the very value of love remains an important part of the Russian sacred code. Oblomov implements the sacred code of Russian culture in the language of mythologems. Unlike Buddhism, the Christian sacred code includes the concepts of love and personality, contrasting them with sleep as a metaphor for the bustle of life.;"[Sergey, S.

The analysis of weld geometry shows that the heat-affected zone (HAZ) width, nugget diameter, and nugget area tend to decrease rapidly, while the nugget height tends to increase with the weld repetitions until the welding heat input becomes too small to form an effective nugget. The maximum displacement and failure energy of the welded joints show a decreasing trend during the welding electrode failure process, while the peak load increases slightly until the 88th weld and then decreases. The cavities and pores in the nugget mainly appear after the 176th spot weld. The electrode diameter increases during welding. The reason for the increase in electrode diameter may be that the contact area between the electrode and the BH 220 steel sheets becomes smaller in the welding process, which causes the continuous sticking phenomenon between the electrode and the BH 220 steel sheets. In the absence of alloying, the edge of the electrode is geometrically deformed, while Cu-Zn-Fe alloying occurs in the area in contact with the BH 220 steel sheet.;"[Zhao, Dawei; Vdonin, Nikita; Bezgans, Yuriy] South Ural State Univ, Inst Engn & Technol, Dept Welding Engn, Chelyabinsk 454080, Russia; [Radionova, Lyudmila] Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Met, Bolshaya Semyonovskaya St 38, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Glebov, Lev] South Ural State Univ, Inst Engn & Technol, Dept Met Forming, Chelyabinsk 454080, Russia";"South Ural State University; Moscow Polytechnic University; South Ural State University";Zhao, DW (corresponding author), South Ural State Univ, Inst Engn & Technol, Dept Welding Engn, Chelyabinsk 454080, Russia.;chzhaod@susu.ru;"Zhao, Dawei/AAU-9928-2020; Glebov, Lev/JLL-8177-2023; Zhao, Da-wei/V-3557-2018; Radionova, Liudmila V./K-2444-2015; Bezgans, Yuriy Viktorovich/N-7055-2014";"Zhao, Dawei/0000-0002-3865-2958; Zhao, Da-wei/0000-0002-7817-4719; Radionova, Liudmila V./0000-0001-9587-2925;";Russian Science Foundation [22-29-20095];Russian Science Foundation(Russian Science Foundation (RSF));This investigation is supported by the Russian Science Foundation (22-29-20095).;;34;7;7;0;4;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;2073-4352;;CRYSTALS;Crystals;JAN;2023;13;1;;;;;;;39;10.3390/cryst13010039;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/cryst13010039;;;17;"Crystallography; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Crystallography; Materials Science";7Y5UP;;gold, Green Submitted;;;2024-04-12;WOS:000914944400001;View Full Record in Web of Science

When modeling thermal loads, film conductors on silicon with a thickness of up to 3 mu m and a width of 10-75 mu m were considered. Based on the experimental oscillograms taken from sections of the test structures during the passage of a current pulse and the calculation performed, the maximum temperatures on the silicon surface near the thermal shock source were determined. It has been experimentally revealed that the passage of current pulses with an amplitude of 2 x 10(11) A/m(2) and a duration of up to 250 mu s leads to thermal destruction of interconnects and contributes to the formation of plastic deformation regions in the near-surface layer of silicon. It was revealed that with a decrease in the track width, the nature of the melting of the film conductor does not change. It was also established that a significantly higher specific energy is required to melt narrower tracks.

The liquidus projection of the Al-Ca-Cu system in the aluminum corner has been suggested based on experiential studies of the microstructure and phase composition of model alloys. The suggested structure of the diagram has two quasi-binary sections: (Al)-Al27Ca3Cu7 and (Al)-Al8CaCu4 and three invariant eutectic transformations: L ->(Al) + (Al,Cu)(4)Ca + Al27Ca3Cu7 (at 5.6 wt.% Ca, 4.5 wt.% Cu, 595 degrees C), L ->(Al) + Al27Ca3Cu7 + Al8CaCu4 (at 2.2 wt.% Ca, 13.5 wt.% Cu, 594 degrees C) and L ->(Al) + Al8CaCu4 + Al2Cu (at 0.5 wt.% Ca, 34 wt.% Cu, 544 degrees C). The limit solubility of copper in aluminum solid solution (Al) at 530 degrees C reaches similar to 5.1 wt.% in the ternary phase field (Al) + Al8CaCu4 + Al2Cu and drops to similar to 2.4 wt.% in the (Al) + Al8CaCu4 + Al27Ca3Cu7 ternary phase field.

The perspective of a decrease in the content of lanthanum from 2 to 0.5 wt % in new alloys has been validated using advanced methods for analyzing the structure and phase composition (electron microscopy, X-ray phase analysis, thermodynamic calculation) and using the analysis of mechanical (tensile) properties formed in the course of deformation treatment. The evolution of the structure of the alloys was studied in the course of thermodeformation treatment. It has been shown that upon hot rolling at 400 degrees C with no preliminary annealing of ingots it is possible to obtain high-quality deformed semiproducts (sheets) with no surface and edge defects (up to a 90% reduction). The deformation treatment provides the formation of a structure with inclusions of a (Al,Mn)(4)(Ca,La) eutectic phase uniformly distributed in an aluminum matrix and found in a form of ring-shaped precipitates of submicron sizes (300 x 150 nm). In addition, the formation of a net of low-angle boundaries (subgrains) with a mean size of similar to 1 mu m is observed; some inclusions of a eutectic phase are found along these boundaries. This combination of structural characteristics mainly determines the ability of reaching favorable mechanical properties of an alloy after hot rolling with 0.5 wt % La (the ultimate strength of 240-260 MPa, yield strength of 185-205 MPa, and relative elongation of 5.5-9.0%), which are comparable with the properties of the previously studied alloy with up to 2 wt % La.";"[Letyagin, N.

The high-quality sheet metal obtained upon hot rolling at 400-450(degrees)C confirms the high processability of new materials. Deformation processing leads to the formation of fine sub-grain structure with a characteristic sub-grain size of 1 mu m. Very fine crystals of the Al4Ca phase particles are found at sub-grain boundaries, confirming their high pinning ability. Tensile tests of the as-wrought alloys revealed that addition of Ca in the Al-Mg alloys leads to a substantial increase in the strength properties (the ultimate tensile strength is in the 300-340 MPa range and the yield strengh is in 230-250 MPa range). Detailed analysis of various mechanisms influencing the strengthening of the new alloys revealed that contribution of sub-grain boundaries is the greatest and greatly exceeds all others: its contribution to the total YS is > 60%. Thus, addition of eutectic forming calcium in wrought Al-Mg alloys allows one to increase the strength properties through the stabilization of the sub-grain structure.;"[Akopyan, T.

It has been shown that the formation of nanosized Al20Cu2Mn3 dispersoids (similar to 7 vol.%) provides for the preservation of the non-recrystallized grain structure after annealing at up to 400 degrees C (3 h), while Mg and Zn have a positive effect on the strength due to the formation of alloyed aluminum solid solution. As a result, cold-rolled sheets of the Al2Cu1.5Mn1Mg1Zn model alloy showed a substantially higher strength performance after annealing at 400 degrees C in comparison with the ternary reference alloy. In particular, the UTS is similar to 360 vs. similar to 300 MPa, and the YS is 280 vs. 230 MPa. For the example of the Al2Cu1.5Mn1Mg1Zn model alloy, it has been shown that the system is promising for designing new heat-resistant alloys as a sustainable alternative to the 2xxx alloys. The new alloy has an advantage over the commercial alloys (particularly, 2219, 2024, 2014), not only in manufacturability but also in thermal stability. The sheet production cycle for the model alloy is much shorter because the stages of homogenization, solution treatment, and water quenching are excluded.;"[Belov, Nikolay; Akopyan, Torgom; Tsydenov, Kirill; Letyagin, Nikolay; Fortuna, Anastasya] Natl Univ Sci & Technol MISiS, Dept Met Forming, 4 Leninsky Pr, Moscow 119049, Russia; [Akopyan, Torgom; Letyagin, Nikolay] Moscow Polytech Univ, Sect Sci Act, 38 Bolshaya Semyonovskaya Str, Moscow 107023, Russia";"National University of Science & Technology (MISIS); Moscow Polytechnic University";"Akopyan, T (corresponding author), Natl Univ Sci & Technol MISiS, Dept Met Forming, 4 Leninsky Pr, Moscow 119049, Russia.;Akopyan, T (corresponding author), Moscow Polytech Univ, Sect Sci Act, 38 Bolshaya Semyonovskaya Str, Moscow 107023, Russia.";"belov.na@misis.ru; akopyan.tk@misis.ru; n.v.letyagin@gmail.com";;;Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation [075-15-2021-696];Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation;The results were obtained by using the equipment of the Center for Collective Use Materials Science and Metallurgy' with the financial support of the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation (#075-15-2021-696).;;46;1;1;6;7;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;2075-4701;;METALS-BASEL;Metals;AUG;2023;13;8;;;;;;;1442;10.3390/met13081442;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/met13081442;;;20;"Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Materials Science; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering";Q3NV6;;gold;;;2024-04-12;WOS:001056626900001;View Full Record in Web of Science

A possible competitive advantage for such enterprises is reducing the finished products cost. This may be achieved by reducing the share of energy in this cost, including by rationalizing the use of energy resources. This study develops a system for the automated analysis and calculation of feasible boiler unit loads, defined according to the criterion of the minimum cost of live steam in a separate steam plant pipeline. The calculations consider the balance limit on the steam, the boiler unit's wear and tear, performance specifications, and economic indicators of fuel consumption in the calculation. The software also defines the optimal fuel mix composition when forecasting the operating modes of the power plant boiler units in real-time mode. The calculation algorithm is based on the dynamic programming technique combined with the sequential equivalenting method, which ensures the convergence of calculations. When a steam plant model is developed, much attention is paid to the thermal scheme and technical and economic specifications of boiler units. In the system, the boiler models are set as a table containing the ratio between the boiler unit's steam capacity and energy consumption while considering the cost of a ton of live steam with the specified parameters. The key economic effect of implementing the system is determined by reducing the fuel cost due to its rational redistribution between the power plant boiler units. Implementing the system allows the reduction of energy costs by 1.4%.;"[Varganova, Aleksandra V.; Khramshin, Vadim R.] Nosov Magnitogorsk State Tech Univ, Power Engn & Automated Syst Inst, Magnitogorsk 455000, Russia; [Radionov, Andrey A.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Automat & Control, Moscow 107023, Russia";"Nosov Magnitogorsk State Technical University; Moscow Polytechnic University";Radionov, AA (corresponding author), Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Automat & Control, Moscow 107023, Russia.;radionov.mail@gmail.com;"Radionov, Andrey/P-4418-2015; Khramshin, Vadim/A-6471-2014";"Radionov, Andrey/0000-0002-3914-4429; Khramshin, Vadim/0000-0003-0972-2803";;;;;30;0;0;4;6;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;1996-1073;;ENERGIES;Energies;MAR;2023;16;6;;;;;;;2596;10.3390/en16062596;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en16062596;;;14;Energy & Fuels;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Energy & Fuels;A5XX3;;gold;;;2024-04-12;WOS:000955861100001;View Full Record in Web of Science

S. Pushkin) and Prince Myshkin (The Idiot by F. M. Dostoevsky). The novelty of the research lies in the authors' attempt to move from an empirical level of understanding the problem to a theoretical one. The methodological basis of the study becomes a semiotic approach to the analysis of literary texts. It is noted that it is the principles of semiotics that make it possible to put the accumulated baggage of empirical knowledge at the basis of a concept that points to the reasons for the double encoding of the characters' images. The purpose of the article is to explain why Mozart and Prince Myshkin realize the image of the ideal person not in the sphere of functioning of the sacred code of culture, but in the sphere of profane culture, where each sacred image corresponds to a symbol related to sacred reality and transforming it. The comparison of the characters of Mozart and Prince Myshkin is based on the commonality of sacred motifs, supplemented by autobiographical, literary, and mythopoetic material. It is argued that these additions indicate the interaction in the consciousness of the writers in creating these images of the sacred, or biblical, code of culture with the profane. It is concluded that Mozart and Prince Myshkin are images created on the basis of double encoding and implying double interpretation.;"[Khromov, Sergey S.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Russian Language & Literature Hist, Moscow, Russia; [Gerasimova, Svetlana V.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Russian & Literature Hist, Moscow, Russia; [Gerasimova, Svetlana V.; Pishulina, Inga A.] Kosygin State Univ Russia, Dept Linguist & Foreign Languages, Moscow, Russia";"Moscow Polytechnic University; Moscow Polytechnic University; Kosygin State University of Russia";"Gerasimova, SV (corresponding author), Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Russian & Literature Hist, Moscow, Russia.;Gerasimova, SV (corresponding author), Kosygin State Univ Russia, Dept Linguist & Foreign Languages, Moscow, Russia.";"chelovek653@mail.ru; metanoik@gmail.com; ingapishulina@yandex.ru";"Gerasimova, Svetlana Valentinovna/AAY-2626-2020; Khromov, Sergey/HKW-4038-2023";"Gerasimova, Svetlana Valentinovna/0000-0002-6150-5155;";;;;;46;0;0;1;1;TSENTR NAUCHNYKH & OBRAZOVATELNYKH PROEKTOV;EKATERINBURG;PR-KT KOSMONAVTOV, DOM 43, KV 57, EKATERINBURG, 620098, RUSSIA;2225-756X;2227-1295;;NAUCH DIALOG;Nauch.

In the last several years, special attention has been paid to the anelastic properties of these alloys. In this review, we collected and analyzed the frequency-, amplitude-, and temperature-dependent anelasticity in Fe-Ga and Fe-Ga-based alloys in the Hertz range of forced and free-decay vibrations. Special attention is paid to anelasticity caused by phase transitions: for this purpose, in situ neutron diffraction tests with the same heating or cooling rates were carried out in parallel with temperature dependencies measurements to control ctructure and phase transitions. The main part of this review is devoted to anelastic effects in binary Fe-Ga alloys, but we also consider ternary alloys of the systems Fe-Ga-Al and Fe-Ga-RE (RE-Rare Earth elements) to discuss similarities and differences between anelastic properties in Fe-Ga and Fe-Al alloys and effect of RE elements. We report and discuss several thermally activated effects, including Zener- and Snoek-type relaxation, several transient anelastic phenomena caused by phase transitions (D0(3) <-> A2, D0(3) -> L1(2), L1(2) <-> D0(19), D0(19) <-> B2, Fe13Ga9 -> L-12+Fe6Ga5 phases), and their influence on the above-mentioned thermally activated effects. We also report amplitude-dependent damping caused by dislocations and magnetic domain walls and try to understand the paradox between the Smith-Birchak model predicting higher damping capacity for materials with higher saturation magnetostriction and existing experimental results. The main attention in this review is paid to alloys with 17-20 and 25-30%Ga as the alloys with the best functional (magnetostriction) properties. Nevertheless, we provide information on a broader range of alloys from 6 to 45%Ga. Due to the limited space, we do not discuss other mechanical and physical properties in depth but focus on anelasticity. A short introduction to the theory of anelasticity precedes the main part of this review of anelastic effects in Fe-Ga and related alloys and unsolved issues are collected in summary.;"[Golovin, Igor S.

The article presents the model implemented in the Labcar system and confirms its adequacy by comparing it with the data obtained during the full-scale prototype tests. The bench and range tests of a test vehicle with electric transmission equipped with a measuring complex confirmed the adequacy of the developed model. The results of comparative tests allow for the conclusion that the developed model complex is suitable for modeling purposes, including studying, debugging and initial calibrations of the algorithm of torque distribution on the driving axles of all-wheel drive electric vehicle.;"[Zavatsky, Alexander M.] Cent Sci Res Automobile & Automot Engines Inst NAM, Automotornaya St 2, Moscow 125438, Russia; [Keller, Andrey V.; Shadrin, Sergey S.; Makarova, Daria A.] Sociocenter, Tverskoy Blvd 13,Str 1, Moscow 123104, Russia; [Keller, Andrey V.; Shadrin, Sergey S.; Makarova, Daria A.; Furletov, Yury M.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Bolshaya Semyonovskaya St 38, Moscow 107023, Russia";Moscow Polytechnic University;Furletov, YM (corresponding author), Moscow Polytech Univ, Bolshaya Semyonovskaya St 38, Moscow 107023, Russia.;"aleksandr.zavatskiy@nami.ru; andreikeller@rambler.ru; s.s.shadrin@mospolytech.ru; makarovadaria224@gmail.com; yury.furletov@gmail.com";Shadrin, Sergey/J-3048-2014;"Shadrin, Sergey/0000-0002-2606-9984; Zavatskiy, Aleksandr/0000-0003-0616-1350";Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation [FZRR-2023-0007];Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation;The research was carried out with the financial support of the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation within the framework of the project Development of a mathematical model of chassis operation (transmission, chassis and control mechanisms) in static and dynamic states and creation of a digital twin of a passenger car platform on its basis (code:FZRR-2023-0007).;;24;0;0;2;2;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;1996-1073;;ENERGIES;Energies;OCT;2023;16;20;;;;;;;7144;10.3390/en16207144;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en16207144;;;17;Energy & Fuels;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Energy & Fuels;W2CK4;;gold;;;2024-04-12;WOS:001089760500001;View Full Record in Web of Science

The individual effect of the welding variables (welding speed, welding current, and wire feed speed) on the geometries of the weld bead and its tensile properties was explored. The characteristics of the microstructure and macrostructure with various welding technological parameters were also investigated. It is indicated that all the selected welding process parameters significantly affect the welding microstructural and macrostructural features of the welded joints as well as their tensile properties. The results imply that no major defects were observed based on the macrostructure examination. The fusion zone (FZ) changes ferrite and pearlite morphology, relying upon the cooling speed and duration time. The FZ exhibits acicular ferrite, Widmanstatten ferrite, and grain boundary ferrite, resulting in its inferior hardness to that of the coarse grain heat-affected zone (CGHAZ) and weld interface (WI). The adjustment of the welding process parameters bringing about the reduction of the welding heat input contributes to the production of acicular ferrite. The hardness of the weld metal steadily decreases from the heat-affected zone (HAZ) to the base metal (BM). The average tensile strength of the weld metal is 596 MPa, which is comparable to that of the BM. The fracture location is in BM, and the fracture behavior retains ductility. After that, models computing the correlations between welding parameters and welding quality indexes (failure energy of the welded joints, depth of the penetration and bottom reinforcement, and standard derivation of the failure energy) were established and analyzed. The optimal welding parameters were figured out using the desirability approach.;"[Zhao, Dawei; Bezgans, Yuriy; Vdonin, Nikita] South Ural State Univ, Inst Engn & Technol, Dept Welding Engn, Chelyabinsk 454080, Russia; [Radionova, Lyudmila] Moscow Polytech Univ, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Glebov, Lev; Bykov, Vitaly] South Ural State Univ, Inst Engn & Technol, Dept Met Forming, Chelyabinsk 454080, Russia";"South Ural State University; Moscow Polytechnic University; South Ural State University";Zhao, DW (corresponding author), South Ural State Univ, Inst Engn & Technol, Dept Welding Engn, Chelyabinsk 454080, Russia.;zhaodawei0322@xy.hfut.edu.cn;"Bezgans, Yuriy Viktorovich/N-7055-2014; Zhao, Da-wei/V-3557-2018; Glebov, Lev/JLL-8177-2023; Zhao, Dawei/AAU-9928-2020; Radionova, Liudmila V./K-2444-2015";"Zhao, Da-wei/0000-0002-7817-4719; Zhao, Dawei/0000-0002-3865-2958; Radionova, Liudmila V./0000-0001-9587-2925";;;;;28;2;2;3;5;SPRINGER LONDON LTD;LONDON;236 GRAYS INN RD, 6TH FLOOR, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND;0268-3768;1433-3015;;INT J ADV MANUF TECH;Int.

The aim of the research is to study the compressibility of composite materials obtained by varying the degree of impregnation of a non-woven needle-punched cloth with an aqueous dispersion of polyurethane. Materials and research methods. Non-woven needle-punched cloth made of polyethylene terephthalate fibers (TU 6- 13-0204077-95-91) with a linear density of 0.33 tex (diameter 20-25 microns) was used as objects of research. For impregnation, an aqueous dispersion of anionic stabilized aliphatic polyethiruretane of the brand IMPRANIL DL 1380 (PRC) with a dry residue of 40% was used. The compressibility of canvases and composite materials was established using the ICH indicator according to GOST 577-68 with an accuracy of measuring the thickness of +/- 0.001 mm. Results and discussion. An approach is proposed to establish the relationship between the degree of compressibility of composite materials and the load and to obtain an equation for predicting the degree of compressibility of composite materials from the degree of impregnation and load. Optimal loading conditions of the composite material with a minimum degree of compressibility has been established. Conclusion.

It is discovered that there are significant differences in the experimental data on temperature modes obtained by many authors. A new dynamic method of measurement of overheating temperature in the active region of p-n structures at pre-set direct current is applied. This method is based on registration of the transient processes of direct voltage changes during heating by pre-set current and cooling-down after switching-off of the heating current at constant low direct current. The formula is obtained for calculation of the proportion factor of direct-voltage temperature dependence for diodes with different techno structures accounting for the measurement current, the non-ideality factor of the voltage-current curve, and temperature. The experimental curves of the LED active region temperature dependence on heating current at its density of (10-110) A/cm(2) and dissipated power of (0.025-0.45) W are obtained. The direct-voltage temperature dependence proportion factor was modelled at different values of measurement current for specific LEDs. It is demonstrated that the active region of LEDs based on wide-band-gap semiconductors overheats due to formation of hot charge carriers interacting with optic phonons in it at current densities, when the exponential nature of the voltage-current curve is disturbed.;"[Varlamov, Dmitry O.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Elect Equipment & Ind Elect Subdept, Moscow, Russia; [Manyakhin, Feodor I.] Natl Univ Sci & Technol MISIS, Automat Design Subdept, Moscow, Russia; [Skvortsov, Arkady A.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Moscow, Russia";"Moscow Polytechnic University; National University of Science & Technology (MISIS); Moscow Polytechnic University";Manyakhin, FI (corresponding author), Natl Univ Sci & Technol MISIS, Automat Design Subdept, Moscow, Russia.;zaomisis@yandex.ru;;;;;;;21;0;0;1;1;ZNACK PUBLISHING HOUSE;MOSCOW;PO BOX 648, 10100 MOSCOW, RUSSIA;0236-2945;;;LIGHT ENG;Light Eng.;;2023;31;3;;;;;91;99;;10.33383/2022-048;http://dx.doi.org/10.33383/2022-048;;;9;"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Optics";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Engineering; Optics";K7PB7;;;;;2024-04-12;WOS:001018311300011;View Full Record in Web of Science

The program allows us to calculate drawing stress, drawing force, tensile strength and yield strength of the alloy after wire drawing, safety factor, and drawing power. The developed mathematical model differs in that it allows us to evaluate the uniformity of deformation over the wire section, depending on the technological parameters of the deformation zone, namely, the semi-angular die, the coefficient of friction and the degree of deformation. To select the technological parameters of the deformation zone, which ensure uniform deformation over the wire cross-section, a nomogram was compiled. The equations of hardening during nickel NP2 wire drawing are obtained. The calculation of energy-power parameters of drawing nickel NP2 (Ni 99.6) wire null 1.8 mm from null 4.94 mm wire rod is given. Experimental studies have been carried out to determine the energy-power parameters of nickel wire drawing on a laboratory drawing machine with an installed ring strain gauge to determine the drawing force. A change in the friction coefficient by 0.02 when drawing nickel wire leads to an increase in stress and drawing force by 20%. To improve the accuracy of the developed mathematical model, it is shown that in the future, it would be necessary to conduct experimental studies on a laboratory drawing machine to determine the effect on the energy-power parameters of the drawing process of the values of technological parameters entered into the program as constant real values, such as the friction coefficient, die half-angle, drawing speed, and back tension.;"[Radionova, Liudmila V.; Gromov, Dmitry V.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Met, Bolshaya Semyonovskaya Str 38, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Lisovskiy, Roman A.; Erdakov, Ivan N.] South Ural State Univ, Dept Met Forming, Lenin Prospect 76, Chelyabinsk 454080, Russia";"Moscow Polytechnic University; South Ural State University";Radionova, LV (corresponding author), Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Met, Bolshaya Semyonovskaya Str 38, Moscow 107023, Russia.;radionovalv@rambler.ru;Radionova, Liudmila V./K-2444-2015;"Radionova, Liudmila V./0000-0001-9587-2925; Erdakov, Ivan/0000-0003-2005-4439";;;;;45;1;1;4;5;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;2075-1702;;MACHINES;Machines;FEB;2023;11;2;;;;;;;252;10.3390/machines11020252;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/machines11020252;;;13;"Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Engineering, Mechanical";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Engineering;9K4DD;;gold;;;2024-04-12;WOS:000940819300001;View Full Record in Web of Science

There are several ways to dispose of used oils: regeneration, burial and incineration. The burning of waste oils is widespread both in Russia and abroad. One of the significant disadvantages of the method is the entry of harmful substances into the atmosphere. The results of research on the development of a more advanced installation of thermal utilization of waste oils, ensuring the completeness of combustion and reduction of harmful emissions, are presented. The unit for thermal disposal of waste oils consists of a furnace and an emulsion nozzle. The furnace from the furnace chamber and the afterburning chamber of the flue gas provides two-zone, two-stage oil gorenje. Oil is burned in the combustion chamber (1st gorenje zone with t approximate to 600-700 oC). Then the smoke enters the afterburning chamber, where it is completely burned due to the supply of additional air (2nd gorenje zone with t approximate to 1200-1300 oC), due to the increase in temperature, toxic substances contained in the smoke are transformed into harmless due to their complete oxidation.The emulsion nozzle consists of intersecting grooves, which, when air and heated oil are fed into it, provide finely dispersed oil spraying by forming gas-liquid vortices in the oncoming grooves. Using the ANSYS program, the calcula-tion of the flame angle of the emulsion nozzle was carried out. It is established that to change the range of the spraying torch and the use of emulsion nozzles in furnaces of different volume and power, it is necessary to change the angle of the screw direction. This research contributes to the development of the industry of processing of production and consumption waste. The proposed solution allows the installation to be used not only in industrial centers where significant volumes of waste oils accumulate, but also in sparsely populated areas, and also ensures the completeness of combustion of oil waste and reduces the negative impact on the environment.;"[V.

The experimental results have been compared with data for the AA2219 commercial alloy pertaining to the same alloying system. Hot deformation of an experimental alloy causes the precipitation of similar to 100 nm sized dispersoids and refinement of the eutectic phase particles. The yield strength and relative elongation of the hot-deformed experimental alloy are 255 MPa and 8.6%, respectively. Subsequent cold deformation reduces the relative elongation by 3.5% and increases the yield strength by 50 MPa, while the ultimate tensile strength does not change. After long-term 350 degree celsius exposure, the mechanical properties of the experimental alloy remain the same as those of the as-deformed one, whereas the yield strength of the 2219 alloy decreases by 2 times and the ultimate tensile strength by 1.4 times. Comparison of these experimental results with data for the 2219 alloy and other Al-Cu-Mn system alloys cited in this work and reported elsewhere suggests that a good thermal stability of Al-2Cu-2Mn-0.4Si-0.2Zr alloy rolled stock can be achieved through treatment using the regimes designed herein.;"[Koshmin, Alexander] Moscow Polytech Univ, Sci Act Sect, Bolshaya Semyonovskaya 38, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Koshmin, Alexander; Cherkasov, Stanislav; Gamin, Yury] Natl Univ Sci & Technol MISiS, Dept Met Forming, Leninsky Prospekt 4, Moscow 119049, Russia; [Fortuna, Anastasiya] Natl Univ Sci & Technol MISIS, Dept Phys Mat Sci, Leninsky Prospekt 4, Moscow 119049, Russia; [Churyumov, Alexander] Natl Univ Sci & Technol MISiS, Dept Phys Met Nonferrous Met, Leninsky Prospekt 4, Moscow 119049, Russia";"Moscow Polytechnic University; National University of Science & Technology (MISIS); National University of Science & Technology (MISIS); National University of Science & Technology (MISIS)";"Koshmin, A (corresponding author), Moscow Polytech Univ, Sci Act Sect, Bolshaya Semyonovskaya 38, Moscow 107023, Russia.;Koshmin, A (corresponding author), Natl Univ Sci & Technol MISiS, Dept Met Forming, Leninsky Prospekt 4, Moscow 119049, Russia.";"koshmin.an@misis.ru; y.gamin@misis.ru; churyumov@misis.ru";"Yury, Gamin/D-9196-2019; Koshmin, Alexander/AAN-3903-2021; Churyumov, Alexander/A-6774-2014";"Yury, Gamin/0000-0001-6654-4236; Koshmin, Alexander/0000-0002-4095-1658; Churyumov, Alexander/0000-0003-0933-056X";Moscow Polytechnic University;Moscow Polytechnic University;No Statement Available;;33;0;0;0;0;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;2075-4701;;METALS-BASEL;Metals;DEC;2023;13;12;;;;;;;2019;10.3390/met13122019;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/met13122019;;;12;"Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Materials Science; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering";DN6L4;;;;;2024-04-12;WOS:001132764800001;View Full Record in Web of Science

The relationships among macrostructure, microstructure, mechanical properties, and failure modes of welded joints of HSLA 420 steel were studied. An optical microscope was employed to describe the microstructure, macrostructure, and geometry of the welds, while their mechanical properties and failure modes were characterized via tensile shear tests. It turns out to be that the weld nugget mainly contains lath martensite. The results of the microhardness test show that the microhardness of the fusion zone (FZ) is superior to those of the heat-affected zone (HAZ) and base metal (BM). The increase in heat input brings about a decrease in FZ martensite hardness, but the hardness distribution is more uniform. The grain size of the FZ is 38 mu m, 51 mu m, and 62 mu m when the welding time is at the levels of 11 cycles, 15 cycles, and 19 cycles, while its values increased by about 58% as the welding current increases from 7.2 to 9.6 kA. As the welding time increases, the differences between the maximum hardness and minimum hardness decrease from 74 to 54 HV. In the tensile shear test, interfacial fracture and pullout fracture were observed, followed by BM sheet tearing. Evidently, the weld nugget with the size of 4t(0.5) (t = sheet thickness) will not bring about pullout fracture. Furthermore, existing standards for determining the acceptable load capacity of welded joints cannot guarantee good welding quality. Finally, moderate welding current (from 8.4 to 9 kA) and long welding time (above 15 cycles) should be used to obtain the welded joints with sufficiently large FZs which present good mechanical properties in the tensile shear test.;"[Zhao, Dawei; Vdonin, Nikita; Bezgans, Yuriy] South Ural State Univ, Dept Welding Engn, Chelyabinsk 454080, Russia; [Radionova, Lyudmila] Moscow Polytech Univ, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Bykov, Vitaly; Glebov, Lev] South Ural State Univ, Dept Met Forming, Chelyabinsk 454080, Russia";"South Ural State University; Moscow Polytechnic University; South Ural State University";Zhao, DW (corresponding author), South Ural State Univ, Dept Welding Engn, Chelyabinsk 454080, Russia.;zhaodawei0322@xy.hfut.edu.cn;"Zhao, Dawei/AAU-9928-2020; Glebov, Lev/JLL-8177-2023; Bezgans, Yuriy Viktorovich/N-7055-2014; Radionova, Liudmila V./K-2444-2015; Zhao, Da-wei/V-3557-2018";"Zhao, Dawei/0000-0002-3865-2958; Radionova, Liudmila V./0000-0001-9587-2925; Zhao, Da-wei/0000-0002-7817-4719";Russian Science Foundation [22-29-20095];Russian Science Foundation(Russian Science Foundation (RSF));The authors are thankful for the financial support offered by the Russian Science Foundation (22-29-20095).;;43;3;3;6;8;SPRINGER LONDON LTD;LONDON;236 GRAYS INN RD, 6TH FLOOR, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND;0268-3768;1433-3015;;INT J ADV MANUF TECH;Int.

The aim is to determine the influence of physical activity in physical education lessons on the vestibular stability indicators of schoolchildren. The main objectives of the study are to study the problems of children's health, to determine the factors that improve it, to identify the role of physical culture for the health and development of schoolchildren. The study was conducted in a secondary school in Russia, it was attended by ninth graders aged 15-16 years in the number of 141 schoolchildren. The main research method was the Turns on the gym bench, which determines the level of vestibular stability development of schoolchildren. The test was used before and after the physical education lesson 1 time per month for 5 months. Children who did not engage in physical education in the lesson were not able to significantly improve their performance in the test, which indicates a possible adaptation to the test after its first performance before the lesson. Children who were engaged in physical exercises were able to significantly increase the test results. The results obtained determine the effectiveness of the influence of a physical education lesson at school on the indicators of children's vestibular stability. This study will serve as an additional motivation for children to engage in physical culture, since the impact of physical exercises has a positive effect not only on the development of physical qualities, but also on the vestibular stability of schoolchildren.;"[Polevoy, Georgiy] Moscow Polytech Univ, Moscow, Russia; [Polevoy, Georgiy] Vyatka State Univ, Kirov, Russia";"Moscow Polytechnic University; Vyatka State University";"Polevoy, G (corresponding author), Moscow Polytech Univ, Moscow, Russia.;Polevoy, G (corresponding author), Vyatka State Univ, Kirov, Russia.";;Polevoy, Georgiy/M-2155-2016;Polevoy, Georgiy/0000-0002-3300-3908;;;;;40;0;0;0;1;INT JOURNAL LIFESCIENCE & PHARMA RESEARCH;TAMILNADU;PLOT NO 10, 2 MAIN RD, RENGA NAGAR NEAR TO OLD ALPHA SCH, SATHANOOR MAIN RD, TIRUCHIRAPALLI, TAMILNADU, INDIA;2250-0480;;;INT J LIFE SCI PHARM;Int.

An expression is obtained for determining the critical radius of the wetting perimeter, which corresponds to the possibility of compensating the linear tension along the surface of the sphere. Here it is appropriate to draw an analogy between the dependence of surface tension on the radius of a liquid drop and the dependence of the linear tension on the curvature of the three-phase contact line. The technology for extracting gold microdispersions from ore by introducing carrier minerals into the system was tested. As carrier minerals, a rough concentrate was used, separated from the ore according to the jet flotation scheme.

Corrosive environment: gas condensate under a pressure of 6.5-7.5 MPa, temperature of 60 degrees C and density of 826 kg/m3 contained water with a total mineralization of 12.75 g/m3, hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide 3.5 and 4.76% (vol.), respectively. A fragment is cut out of the pipe at the inner surface that has through corrosion failure in the form of a triangle, at the base of which, apparently there is a manufacturing macro defect that propagates in the direction of gas condensate movement. Corrosion damage located along the perimeter of the triangle has two characteristic areas: uniform, close to a through hole, and intense corrosion. The width of each of the regions reaches 30 mm in the areas located at the apex of a triangle. The transition from uniform to intense corrosion is accompanied by formation of black protrusions 4-6 mm high and up to 3 mm in diameter, which collapse during transition into the area of general uniform corrosion observed over the rest of the pipe inner surface. The authors attribute features of the nature of corrosion damage observed to interaction of corrosion-active non-metallic inclusions (CANI) with gas condensate and an accelerating effect of hydrogen penetrating into steel on the corrosion process along with appearance and an increase in the level of triaxial tensile stresses in the vicinity of corrosion-active non-metallic inclusions.;"[Guzenkova, A.

When compared to standard dose rate radiation therapy, numerous preclinical investigations have demonstrated that FL-RT provides similar benefits in conserving normal tissue while maintaining equal antitumor efficacy, a phenomenon possible due to the 'FLASH effect' (FE) of FL-RT. The methodologies involve proton radiotherapy, intensity-modulated radiation treatment, and managing high-throughput damage by radiation to solid tissues. Recent results from animal studies indicate that FL-RT can reduce radiation-induced tissue damage, significantly enhancing anticancer potency. Focusing on the potential benefits of FL proton beam treatment in the years to come, this review details the FL-RT research that has been done so far and the existing theories illuminating the FL effects. This subject remains of interest, with many issues still needing to be answered. We offer a brief review to emphasize a few of the key efforts and difficulties in moving FL radiation research forward. The existing research state of FL-RT, its affecting variables, and its different specific impacts are presented in this current review. Key topics discussed include the biochemical mechanism during FL therapy, beam sources for FL therapy, the FL effect on immunity, clinical and preclinical studies on the protective effect of FL therapy, and parameters for effective FL therapy.;"[Polevoy, Georgiy Georgievich] Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Phys Educ, Moscow, Russia; [Kumar, Devika S.] Saveetha Inst Med & Tech Sci SIMATS, Dept Res & Dev, Chennai, India; [Daripelli, Sushma] ABV Govt Degree Coll, Dept Chem, Jangaon, India; [Prasanna Sr, Muthu] Surya Grp Inst, Dept Pharmaceut Biotechnol, Vikravandi Rf, Tamil Nadu, India";Moscow Polytechnic University;Prasanna, M Sr (corresponding author), Surya Grp Inst, Dept Pharmaceut Biotechnol, Vikravandi Rf, Tamil Nadu, India.;;Polevoy, Georgiy/M-2155-2016;"Polevoy, Georgiy/0000-0002-3300-3908; S Kumar, Dr. Devika/0000-0002-4442-9197";;;;;44;0;0;7;7;SPRINGERNATURE;LONDON;CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND;;2168-8184;;CUREUS J MED SCIENCE;Cureus J Med Sci;OCT 12;2023;15;10;;;;;;;e46928;10.7759/cureus.46928;http://dx.doi.org/10.7759/cureus.46928;;;8;Medicine, General & Internal;Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI);General & Internal Medicine;U2SB9;38021805;Green Published, gold;;;2024-04-12;WOS:001083341900009;View Full Record in Web of Science

To improve the mechanical properties, an alloy of the Al-Zn-Mg-Ca-Fe system was proposed. In this alloy, when Fe and Ca are added, compact particles of the Al10CaFe2 compound are formed, which significantly reduces the negative effect of Fe on the mechanical properties. Because of the high solidification rate (about 600 K/s) during cylindrical ingot (similar to 33 mm) production, the electromagnetic casting method (ECM) makes it possible to obtain a highly dispersed structure in the cast state. The size of the dendritic cell is similar to 7 mu m, while the entire amount of Fe is bound into eutectic inclusions of the Al10CaFe2 phase with an average size of less than 3 mu m. In this study, the effect of radial shear rolling (RSR) on the formation of the structure and hardening of the Al-8%Zn-3.3%Mg-0.8%Ca-1.1%Fe alloy obtained by EMC was studied. Computer simulation of the RSR process made it possible to analyze the temperature and stress-strain state of the alloy and to select the optimal rolling modes. It was shown that the flow features during RSR and the severe shear strains near the surface of the rod (10 mm) provided a refining and decrease in the size of the initial Fe-containing particles.;"[Gamin, Yury V.; Belov, Nikolay A.; Akopyan, Torgom K.; Cherkasov, Stanislav O.] Natl Univ Sci & Technol MISIS NUST MISIS, Dept Met Forming, 4 Leninsky Pr, Moscow 119049, Russia; [Akopyan, Torgom K.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Mat Sci, 38, Bolshaya Semyonovskaya Str, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Timofeev, Victor N.; Motkov, Mikhail M.] Siberian Fed Univ, Electrotech Dept, 79 Svobodny Pr, Krasnoyarsk 660041, Russia";"Moscow Polytechnic University; Siberian Federal University";Gamin, YV (corresponding author), Natl Univ Sci & Technol MISIS NUST MISIS, Dept Met Forming, 4 Leninsky Pr, Moscow 119049, Russia.;y.gamin@misis.ru;"Yury, Gamin/D-9196-2019; Belov, Nikolay A/A-7901-2014";"Yury, Gamin/0000-0001-6654-4236;";"Russian Science Foundation [22-19-00128]; Moscow Polytechnic University";"Russian Science Foundation(Russian Science Foundation (RSF)); Moscow Polytechnic University";The study was supported by a grant from the Russian Science Foundation (project no. 22-19-00128) (EMC, RSR, FEM, SEM) and by the Moscow Polytechnic University within the framework of the grant named after Pyotr Kapitsa (TEM, HV).;;36;2;2;4;12;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;1996-1944;;MATERIALS;Materials;JAN;2023;16;2;;;;;;;677;10.3390/ma16020677;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ma16020677;;;17;"Chemistry, Physical; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering; Physics, Applied; Physics, Condensed Matter";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Chemistry; Materials Science; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering; Physics";8R2MF;36676420;Green Published, gold;;;2024-04-12;WOS:000927729900001;View Full Record in Web of Science

The problem of using substandard raw materials for traditional methods of enrichment is associated with the problem of strengthening the mineral resource base of metallurgy. Among the directions of extraction of metals from ores, the priority of the problem of waste-free production or the inclusion of waste products from the tail-ings of primary processing into use without restrictions on sanitary conditions is noted. The article substantiates the feasibility of implementing a new direction for the mining industry: involvement in the production of substandard metal-containing raw materials of technogenic origin by leaching in a high-speed disintegrator mill. The results of the state of the mineral resource base of non-ferrous metals are given. New data on the extraction and loss of metals in the process of ore dressing are presented. A decrease in the gap between the content in processing waste and in ore reserves was noted. It is shown that the total value of metals in waste is comparable to the value of potential mineral resources in the subsurface. The expediency of assessing the possibilities of technologies for the utilization of man-made reserves by modeling the processing indicators is substantiated. It is concluded that the problems of using mining waste should be solved in a single package by creating a technological cycle of extraction and processing of man-made waste, the use of which can make the development of technogenic deposits economically profitable. The purpose of research on the prospects of solving the problem concerned is to prove the possibility of extracting metals from man-made raw materials to the desired level which is achieved by using the method of mathematical modeling of metal leaching processes.;"[Valiev, N.

Hot deformation was carried out by the uniaxial compression of cylindrical specimens on a Gleeble 3800 thermomechanical simulator. A dependence is obtained for calculating the kinetics of austenite grain growth for a temperature range of 1150-1250 ?. The proposed dependence makes it possible to evaluate grain growth under non-isothermal conditions. The verification of the adequacy of the proposed dependence and the method for calculating the grain size at cooling rates 0.2, 1 and 5 ?/s showed its high convergence. The difference between the calculated and experimental grain size did not exceed 8%. The suppression of grain growth is due to the precipitation of titanium carbides and carbonitrides.

Pyrotechnic aerosol-forming compositions are effective fire-extinguishing agents due to the high specific surface area of the dispersed particles formed. During combustion, the initial products of the composition turn into dispersed particles in the flame zone with sharp temperature gradients. The initial products of the composition are converted into dispersed particles in the flame zone with sharp temperature gradients. The maximum particle size distribution function is 3 mu m. It is not possible to obtain a similar ensemble of dispersed particles by other physico-mechanical methods. Potassium carbonate as one of the target products is formed in the form of melt particles. Crystallization of potassium carbonate starts from the outside of the melt drop and ends with the formation of crystals with a developed surface. If the integrity of the crystal shell is violated due to a collision with the body of the sampler, the melt crystallizes with the formation of whiskers. Using a scanning electron microscope, the elemental composition of crystals and filamentous structures was determined as potassium carbonate. The observed phenomenon can be recommended as a method for obtaining filamentous crystals.;"[Ksenofontov, S. I.; Tashkova, K. Yu.; Razina, A. G.; Kazakov, V. A.; Smirnov, A. V.; Abrukov, V.

The authors proposed to analyze not only TBC but also EBC from the point of view of the optics of semitransparent scattering and absorbing media in the range of similar to 0.4-4 mu m of external radiant action. This paradigm allows us to continue the study of ceramic fibers embedded in ceramic matrix CMCs (C/C, C/SiC, SiC/SiC) as a traditional class of opaque materials. However, at the same time, mullites, Al2O3/Al2O3 have been reviewed as a class of semitransparent elements for designing CMCs. The relevance of studying the effect of oriented fibers on the formation of thermoradiation and temperature fields in a semitransparent material was noted. Modeling the scattering asymmetry coefficient influence (scattering phase function) on the generation of the subsurface thermal radiation source was carried out. The methodology for calculating the thermoradiative field in a semitransparent medium (with relative absorption, scattering indexes, and scattering asymmetry coefficient) was used under a one-dimensional two-flux model as the first approximation for solving the radiative heat transfer equation.

For power supply systems of mining and processing plants, the task of correctly selecting relay protection devices is particularly acute, due to the occurrence of emergency situations leading to downtime of excavators, drilling machines and other equipment, under-production of ore and, accordingly, to a deterioration in technical and economic performance indicators. Based on this, to ensure electrical safety in the networks of quarries and mining and processing plants (GOK), it is necessary to conduct experimental studies to determine the value of single-phase fault current, both in steady-state and transient modes, which should be carried out according to the developed methodology. It has been established that in order to improve electrical safety conditions during single-phase ground faults, the capacitor bank at the quarry substation should be disconnected. This will reduce the single-phase ground fault current from 25 A to 1.75 A, eliminate the possibility of burning cables, and also reduce the possibility of electric shock to people and reduce the cost of repair and replacement of cables. Further work is required to develop recommendations for protection against single-phase earth faults and to develop proposals for improving the operating modes of electrical equipment at the mining and processing complex open pit. The application of the recommendations developed in the work to increase the selectivity of relay protection in a quarry will reduce downtime of electrical equipment and thereby obtain an additional economic effect.;"[Klyuev, R., V] Moscow Polytech Univ, Moscow, Russia; [Bosikov, I.

The tasks are formulated to achieve the goal. They involve classifying the methods of foreign language teaching based on the competency approach and identifying the effective methods. The methodological basis of this research includes methods of analyzing the practical experience of foreign language teaching based on a competency-based approach, synthesis of national and international experience, comparison of national models of the language environment, and generalization of sociological data. As a result of the conducted research, it has been revealed that among various methods, approaches related to information and communication technologies [ICT] are utilized most often. We believe that when teachers conduct courses using synchronous computer-mediated communication [SCMC] tools or platforms, students should be given opportunities to express their opinions. Most teachers recognize the creation of instructional videos as the most effective. According to the students, this type of activity also has the greatest learning effect and stimulates creativity.

Such an analysis is necessary to identify the potential for energy savings and reduce energy costs per product cost. In the presented work, on the basis of data on the power consumption of a large processing plant, an analysis of the energy characteristics of autogenous grinding mills was carried out. Based on the data on the power consumption of the processing plant departments, statistical estimates were obtained: average (estimation of the mathematical expectation); standard (unbiased estimate of standard deviation). The technological process of grinding separation is given, the regime map of the technological process of the self-grinding body is shown. The utilization factors for active power, the forms of the load schedule, the filling of the load schedule are determined. The dynamics of change in the power value during the hours of the evening maximum of the power system over the decades of the month under study is given. An empirical method for calculating the power of the drive motor of the MMC-70x23 mill is given. The dependence of the power consumption of the MMC engine on the degree of loading and bulk weight of ore is obtained. Comparison of the calculated power of the drive motor with the installed power of the synchronous motor type SDM-16-49-6, equal to 1600 kW, with a gearbox type TSh 125 D indicates that the drive meets the requirements.

The microstructure and phase composition of the HECs were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electronic microscopy. Moreover, the mechanical properties were examined by nanoindentation. It is found that the as-prepared HEC contains the impurities of (Hf, Zr)O2 and amorphous carbon. The oxide and amorphous carbon can be in-situ removed by further carbothermal reduction reaction during the annealing, followed by dissolution of the reduction products into the HEC phase. In other words, the heat treatment can significantly improve the microstructure of the HEC by the removal of impurity and uniform distribution of the compositional elements. In addition, the annealing at 2000 degrees C and 2100 degrees C enhance the mechanical properties of the HEC.

This requires improving techniques for estimating the transformer's health and forecasting its remaining useful life (RUL). A brief review of the problem being solved has shown that the known RUL estimation techniques include processing the results of measuring the facility state parameters using various mathematical methods. Data processing techniques (deep learning, SOLA, etc.) are used, but there is no information on their application in online monitoring systems. Herewith, fast (shock) changes in the resource caused by the failures and subsequent recoveries of the facility's health have not been considered. This reduces the RUL forecasting accuracy for the repairable equipment, including transformers. It is especially relevant to consider the impact of sudden state changes when it comes to furnace transformers due to a cumulative wear effect determined by their frequent connections to the grid (up to 100 times a day). The proposed approach is based on calculating the RUL by analytical dependencies, considering the failures and recoveries of the facility state. For the first time, an engineering RUL forecasting technique has been developed, based on the online diagnostic monitoring data results provided in the form of time series. The equipment's relative failure tolerance index, calculated with analytical dependencies, has first been used in RUL forecasting. As a generalized indicator, a relative failure tolerance index considering the facility's state change dynamics has been proposed. The application of the RUL forecasting technique based on the results of dissolved gas analysis of a ladle furnace unit's transformer is demonstrated. The changes in the transformer state during the operation period from 2014 to 2022 have been studied. The RUL was calculated in the intensive aging interval; the winding dismantling results were demonstrated, which confirmed developing destructive processes in the insulation. The key practical result of the study is reducing accidents and increasing the service life of the arc and ladle furnace transformers. The techno-economic effect aims to ensure process continuity and increase the metallurgical enterprise's output (we cannot quantify this effect since it depends on the performance of a particular enterprise). It is recommended to use the technique to forecast the RUL of repairable facilities equipped with online monitoring systems.";"[Radionov, Andrey A.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Automat & Control, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Liubimov, Ivan V.] South Ural State Univ, Dept Elect Drive & Mechatron, Chelyabinsk 454080, Russia; [Yachikov, Igor M.] South Ural State Univ, Dept Informat Measuring Equipment, Chelyabinsk 454080, Russia; [Abdulveleev, Ildar R.; Khramshina, Ekaterina A.; Karandaev, Alexander S.] Nosov Magnitogorsk State Tech Univ, Power Engn & Automated Syst Inst, Magnitogorsk 455000, Russia";"Moscow Polytechnic University; South Ural State University; South Ural State University; Nosov Magnitogorsk State Technical University";Radionov, AA (corresponding author), Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Automat & Control, Moscow 107023, Russia.;"radionov.mail@gmail.com; liubimoviv@susu.ru; iachikovim@gmail.com; i.abdulveleev@magtu.ru; khramshinaea@gmail.com; askaran@mail.ru";"Yachikov, I.

The scientist's attention to reading, to students' understanding of historical facts and a sober assessment of the political situation sounds relevant today. I.E. Zabelin applied advanced scientific methods, used progressive educational publications, developed author's courses based on historical sources, realized the need for the principle of clarity in teaching. The pedagogical community and the management of educational institutions highly appreciated the efforts of the historian. He read his subject in a fascinating and emotional way, his lectures were remembered by students for many years. The personality of I.E. Zabelin, who brilliantly combined the traits of both a scientist and a teacher, who saw the need not only to teach the subject, but also to educate the younger generation, is a worthy example for our contemporaries.;"[Kokorina, Yulia G.; Vagabov, Machach M.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Moscow, Russia; [Prodanova, Natalia A.] Plekhanov Russian Univ Econ, Moscow, Russia; [Ibragimova, Elmira R.] Kazan Fed Univ, Yelabuga Inst, Kazan, Russia";"Moscow Polytechnic University; Plekhanov Russian University of Economics; Kazan Federal University";Kokorina, YG (corresponding author), Moscow Polytech Univ, Moscow, Russia.;"kokorina@inbox.ru; prodanova-00@mail.ru; 9162803@mail.ru; elmira915@mail.ru";;;;;;;37;0;0;0;0;Cherkas Global Univ Press;Washington;1717 N Street NW, Suite 1, Washington, District of Columbia, UNITED STATES;2073-9745;2310-0028;;BYLYE GODY;Bylye Gody;SEP;2023;18;3;;;;;1170;1178;;10.13187/bg.2023.3.1170;http://dx.doi.org/10.13187/bg.2023.3.1170;;;9;History;Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI);History;Y0AG8;;gold;;;2024-04-12;WOS:001101977500012;View Full Record in Web of Science

In this regard, many scientists are conducting studies on the explosiveness of the use of cutters in mines, but they are mainly aimed not at establishing the causes of methane ignition, but at improving the systems for the pressure of methane flares. The probability of methane ignition, along with other factors, depends on the reinforcement material of the mining tool, which is one of the controversial issues of Russian and foreign researchers. In this regard, studies were carried out aimed at establishing the influence of various materials reinforcing cutters on the likelihood of methane ignition during rock cutting, for which a special stand was made. The results of the experiments showed that the explosions of the methane-air mixture are determined not by the intensity of sparking of the cutter material when it wears out, but by the accumulation of thermal energy, when the critical level of which is reached, the mixture explodes. Moreover, critical energy is achieved faster when cutting rock with harder reinforcing materials.;"[Linnik, Yu. N.; Linnik, V. Yu.] State Univ Management, Moscow, Russia; [Zhabin, A.

This article is devoted to the consideration of the views of the outstanding Russian historian I.E. Zabelin on the role of the concept of nationality and folk life in relation to archaeology. The task of reconstructing the scientist's ideas related to determining the place of archeology in the life of society and the nature of science is solved on the basis of unpublished archival materials. In the course of the study, new accents were placed in his assessment as an archaeologist, teacher, citizen, what is the novelty of this work. The materials of this study were handwritten lecture notes compiled by E.I. Zabelin in the 1860s, for reading in front of an audience consisting of artists, as well as diaries and autobiography of the scientist. In historiography, the work of I.E. Zabelin was not considered in the perspective chosen in this article. In his lectures, I.E. Zabelin argues that modern ideas can be realized only by referring to the heroic past of the people. By nationality in archaeology, a scientist understands the study of both the material and spiritual culture of the past. Based on the history of archeology, the researcher points out the need to study not only classical antiquities, but also monuments of other peoples. Innovative are his reflections on the & DLANGBRAC;living & drangbrac; and dead ways of developing archaeology as a science. The development of archaeological knowledge in Russia, for reasons not always of an academic nature, followed a dead path, which led to small-scale, regional -chronological isolation, and emphasized the empirical nature of research. The thesis of the unity of historical and archaeological knowledge has entered into the tradition of Russian science. I.E. Zabelin in his lectures was repeatedly ahead of his time, justifying the use of the term type of archeology, advocating a combination of archaeological practice and theory, defending the need to study all aspects of folk life. In Russian science, this was talked about more than a century after the lectures of I.E.

In this regard, there is a need not only to revise the structure of urban developments and strategies for their greening, but also to propose new technologies that radically change the ecological situation. In this paper, solutions using phototrophic microorganisms are considered as such a technology. It is shown that photobioreactors for their cultivation can be successfully integrated into urban systems, while in addition to air purification, the problem of surface wastewater treatment for their further use can also be solved.

Underground mining of rock massifs of powerful deposits on deep horizons is accompanied by geomechanical phenomena, which are prevented by the construction of artificial structures made of solid mixtures in the developed space. Controlling geomechanics of the massif increases the completeness of subsoil use and is an actual direction of mining production.Objective: detailing the array state management technology by rationally regulating the voltages in the array.Object: arrays of deposits of the Talnakh ore node.Methods: modeling and experiment, the results of which are the basis for the development of a model and recommendations.Results. The paper introduces the assessment of the behavior of natural and artificial massifs differentially for the main deposits of the ore node. The regularities of combining options for unloading arrays from critical stresses are established: with overworking and with a protec-tive layer underworking. The principles of optimization of ore mining technology taking into account the geomechanical features of the ar-rays are summarized. Measures to increase the volumetric compression of filling mixtures for variants of chamber systems of development are recommended. The results of modeling the influence of the volumes of rock inclusions on the efficiency of field development are pre-sented. A model of ecological and economic assessment of technologies is proposed, taking into account the costs of creating protective layers and reducing the dilution of ores. Unloading of arrays from stresses provides an opportunity to regulate the stress level with a de-crease in deformations, including during selective excavation of ores with the abandonment of rock layers in the bowels.Conclusions. Unloading arrays from operating stresses is an effective measure to solve the main problems of subsurface use at the same time. The implementation of this direction in the conditions of localization of the Talnakh ore deposits can be carried out by advanced ex-cavation of the soil layer. The efficiency of working out stress-deformed arrays is achieved by the rational interaction of natural and techno-logical factors of development.;"[Golik, Vladimir I.] Moscow Polytech Univ, 38 B Semenovskaya St, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Golik, Vladimir I.] Vladikavkaz Sci Ctr, Geophys Inst, 93a Markov St, Vladikavkaz 362002, Russia";"Moscow Polytechnic University; Russian Academy of Sciences; Vladikavkaz Scientific Center; Geophysical Institute, VSC RAS";"Golik, VI (corresponding author), Moscow Polytech Univ, 38 B Semenovskaya St, Moscow 107023, Russia.;Golik, VI (corresponding author), Vladikavkaz Sci Ctr, Geophys Inst, 93a Markov St, Vladikavkaz 362002, Russia.";v.i.golik@mail.ru;;;;;;;23;0;0;1;1;TOMSK POLYTECHNIC UNIV, PUBLISHING HOUSE;TOMSK;30, LENIN AVE, TOMSK, 634050, RUSSIA;2500-1019;2413-1830;;BULL TOMSK POLYTECH;Bull.

The aim of the work is to determine the influence of the structure of the filter materials formed as a result of modification of the surface layer on their water permeability and the size of trapped solid particles. Materials and methods. The non-woven fabrics from a mixture of polyethylene-terephthalate (PET) (70 wt.%) and bicomponent fibers (BCF) of the core-shell structure were used as objects of the study. The non-woven fabrics were obtained by mechanically forming the canvas with its subsequent hardening by needle punching. The resulting materials were modified by heat treatment. The water transfer in the modified materials was determined by the permeability coefficient. The filtration efficiency was determined by the number of trapped particles of a certain size. Results and discussion. The needle-punched non-woven fabrics without additional heat treatment are not suitable for water filtration. The proposed method of thermal and deformation-thermal modification provides the production of gradient materials with a controlled thickness of the nanoscale surface layer. Although a decrease in water permeability is observed, the modified material traps solid particles with a smaller (compared to unmodified similar to 20 mu m) equivalent diameter of 2-4 mu m, which is sufficient to prepare water for use in steam generators and in the production of building materials. Conclusion. The optimal parameters of deformation-heat treatment for obtaining the high-effective filtration non-woven materials were established: the temperature - 180 degrees C, the processing speed - 3.5 m/min.;"[Nazarov, Victor G.; Dedov, Alexander V.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Moscow, Russia; [Ivanov, Leonid A.] Russian Acad Engn, Moscow, Russia; [Bokova, Elena S.] Russian State Univ, Moscow, Russia; [Statnik, Evgeny S.] Skolkovo Inst Sci & Technol, Moscow, Russia";"Moscow Polytechnic University; Skolkovo Institute of Science & Technology";Dedov, AV (corresponding author), Moscow Polytech Univ, Moscow, Russia.;dedovs55@rambler.ru;"Dedov, Alexander/JAN-8989-2023; Nazarov, Victor/B-2274-2014";"Statnik, Eugene/0000-0002-1105-9206; Ivanov, Leonid/0000-0001-9513-8712; , Aleksandr/0000-0001-9636-9467";;;;;22;0;0;3;3;NANOSTROITEL STVO;MOSCOW;GAZETNYI PER-K, DOM 9, STR 4, MOSCOW, 125009, RUSSIA;2075-8545;;;NANOTECHNOL CONSTR;Nanotechnol.

Zabelin as a Teacher of Russian Literature (Based on Archival Materials);BYLYE GODY;;;Russian;Article;;;;;;"history of pedagogy; history of Russia of the second half of the XIX century; I.E. Zabelin; methods of teaching literature in the XIX century; Konstantinovsky Boundary Institute; School of Topographers";;The authors consider the structure and concept of teaching Russian literature by the outstanding Russian historian I.E. Zabelin (1820-1908). The works of a scientist on history and archeology are known in historiography, while the historian's views on Russian literature and its teaching are being considered for the first time. For modern teachers, the appeal to the  Course of Russian Literature, which is stored in the archive of the scientist, allows them to understand the civic essence of teaching literature, the authors introduce archival materials into scientific circulation, uses the diary entries of the scientist and the memories of his students. The pedagogical activity of I.E. Zabelin falls on the years 1853-1869, when the concept of teaching literature was just being developed. The scientist worked at the Konstantinovsky Land Survey Institute and the School of Topographers in an era of heated discussions about the future of the Russian education system. Documents show that I.E. Zabelin stood outside the political forces of that time, but his pedagogical views were clearly progressive, echoed the ideas of the founder of Russian pedagogy K.D. Ushinsky (1823-1871). Zabelin taught to love and understand the ideas and aspirations of his people, and for him the concept of nationality permeates the entire course. The teacher aimed to educate students in love with the Russian word, instilled a culture of thinking and expressing their thoughts. The attention of the scientist to reading, the real anthem of which contains a course of literature, the awareness of the need for a sober assessment of the political situation sounds relevant today. I.E. Zabelin applied advanced scientific methods, used progressive textbooks and anthologies. He interpreted only recently discovered literary monuments, was aware of the latest achievements in literary studies. The depth and value of his course is given by scientists' understanding of the unity of historical and literary knowledge, attention to the theoretical foundations of both sciences, philosophy of knowledge in general. I.E. Zabelin developed the author's Course of Russian Literature based on literary sources, realized the need for a teacher's conversation with students, which would awaken thought, involve the whole class in work, form a civic position among students. Both historical disciplines and literature I.E. Zabelin taught in a fascinating and emotional way, his lectures were remembered by students for many years. The personality of I.E. Zabelin, who brilliantly combined the traits of both a scientist and a teacher, who saw the need not only to teach the subject, but also to educate the younger generation, is a worthy example for our contemporaries.;"[Kokorina, Yulia G.; Vagabov, Makhach M.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Moscow, Russia; [Chernov, Vladislav A.] Pacific Natl Univ, Khabarovsk, Russia; [Moroz, Narkiza A.] Univ Tumen, Tyumen, Russia; [Chernov, Vladislav A.] Far Eastern State Transport Univ, Khabarovsk, Russia";"Moscow Polytechnic University; Pacific National University";Kokorina, YG (corresponding author), Moscow Polytech Univ, Moscow, Russia.;"kokorina@inbox.ru; prof2597@gmail.com; 9162803@mail.ru; narkiza-moroz@mail.ru";;;;;;;39;0;0;0;0;Cherkas Global Univ Press;Washington;1717 N Street NW, Suite 1, Washington, District of Columbia, UNITED STATES;2073-9745;2310-0028;;BYLYE GODY;Bylye Gody;DEC;2023;18;4;;;;;1706;1716;;10.13187/bg.2023.4.1706;http://dx.doi.org/10.13187/bg.2023.4.1706;;;11;History;Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI);History;DY0R2;;gold;;;2024-04-12;WOS:001135536000012;View Full Record in Web of Science

Zabelin;BYLYE GODY;;;English;Article;;;;;;"history of higher education in Russia; teaching of archeology; I; E; Zabelin; archaeological theory; history of archeology; Konstantinovsky Boundary Institute";;I.E. Zabelin (1820-1908) is known as an outstanding historian and archaeologist, but as a teacher of the Russian higher school he is much less known. In this work, the program of the course Russian history in connection with archaeology, stored in the archive of the scientist, is introduced into scientific circulation. Ivan Egorovich gave lectures on historical disciplines to students of the Konstantinovsky Boundary Institute from 1853 to 1865. Turning to the experience of teaching archaeology accumulated by Russian pedagogy opens up a way for modern archaeological education to get out of the state of crisis in which it is located. The identification of I.E. Zabelin's civic position through the prism of his reflections on teaching history and archeology to young people, the clarification of the scientist's contribution to the methodology and didactics of historical disciplines is fundamentally new. The concept of teaching archaeology, which was developed and applied by I.E. Zabelin, has not been considered in detail in the literature. I.E. Zabelin introduces into his course a new study of folk folklore as a source for that time, introduces students to an innovative approach to the study of Slavic settlements, developed by Z. Khodakovsky. The example of the course program shows that I.E. Zabelin was ahead of his time more than once. He grouped ancient artifacts by material and purpose, introduced listeners to the technology of antiquities production. An undoubted contribution to the theory of archaeology is the presentation of archaeology as a historical discipline, which has firmly entered the Russian scientific tradition. I.E. Zabelin was a talented teacher, turned to historical and material sources to create his course, used the principle of clarity in teaching.

To configure and digitally commission automated drives, two-mass electromechanical system models are used. A promising area in which to implement such models is the development of digital shadows, namely drive position observers. Connecting virtual models for online data exchange predetermines the tightening of requirements for their parameter calculation accuracy. Therefore, developing accessible techniques for calculating electromechanical system coordinates is an urgent problem. These parameters are most accurately defined by experiments. The contribution of this paper is the proposition of a method for defining the two-mass system model parameters using the oscillograms obtained in the operating and emergency modes. The method is developed for the horizontal stand drives of a plate mill 5000 and is supported by numerical examples. The technique is universal and comprises calculating the rotating mass inertia torques, elastic stiffness and oscillation damping coefficients, and the time constants of the motor air gap torque control loop. The obtained results have been applied to the development of the elastic torque observer of the rolling stand's electromechanical system. A satisfactory coordinate recovery accuracy has been approved for both open and closed angular gaps in mechanical joints. Recommendations are given for the use of the method in developing process parameter control algorithms based on automated drive position observers. This contributes to the development of the theory and practice of building digital control systems and the implementation of the Industry 4.0 concept in industrial companies.;"[Gasiyarov, Vadim R.; Radionov, Andrey A.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Automat & Control, 38 Bolshaya Semyonovskaya Str, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Loginov, Boris M.; Zinchenko, Mark A.] PJSC Magnitogorsk Iron & Steel Works, Cent Electrotech Lab, Magnitogorsk 455000, Russia; [Gasiyarova, Olga A.] LLC NPP Uchtekh Profi, Dept Mat Sci, 147 Kommuny Str, Chelyabinsk 454080, Russia; [Karandaev, Alexander S.; Khramshin, Vadim R.] Nosov Magnitogorsk State Tech Univ, Power Engn & Automated Syst Inst, 38 Lenin Ave, Magnitogorsk 455000, Russia";"Moscow Polytechnic University; Nosov Magnitogorsk State Technical University";Radionov, AA (corresponding author), Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Automat & Control, 38 Bolshaya Semyonovskaya Str, Moscow 107023, Russia.;"gasiyarovvr@gmail.com; radionov.mail@gmail.com; lb18@yandex.ru; aed174@mail.ru; o.ll.ja1985@gmail.com; askaran@mail.ru; hvrmgn@gmail.com";"Radionov, Andrey/P-4418-2015; Gasiyarov, Vadim/D-5003-2015; Khramshin, Vadim/A-6471-2014";"Radionov, Andrey/0000-0002-3914-4429; Gasiyarov, Vadim/0000-0001-9635-4716; Khramshin, Vadim/0000-0003-0972-2803";Moscow Polytechnic University;Moscow Polytechnic University;This work was financially supported by the Moscow Polytechnic University within theframework of the grant named after Pyotr Kapitsa.;;67;1;1;3;3;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;2504-4494;;J MANUF MATER PROC;J.

The preservation of CNFs in the structure of AMC and the formation of Al4C3 inclusions, which have a higher strength and hardness compared to the initial AlSi10Mg aluminum alloy, lead to hardening of the synthesized material, the microhardness of which is 149 +/- 8 HV, which is 20% higher than the hardness of the AlSi10Mg alloy.;"[Ozherelkov, D.

It was shown that the area per molecule in the dense face-on packing of a monolayer is 1.69 nm2, and in the edge-on packing - 0.90 nm2. Analysis of the floating layer compression isotherm revealed that ZnTPP molecules are arranged face-on to the interface plane. Electron absorption spectroscopy showed that LS-films contain aggregates of J-type. The surface morphology of LS-films studied by AFM revealed that the average roughness of LS-films increases by 1.4 times with an increase in the number of transfers from one to five. The sensing properties of the LS-films (with 15 transfers) with respect to hydroxypyridine and pyridine in aqueous and gaseous media, correspondingly, have been studied.

The effect of the Si- and Ca-alloying elements in aluminum on the growth process, morphology, composition, mechanical, and corrosion properties of the PEO coatings was investigated. Uniform coatings with a minimum number of defects were formed on the surfaces of Al-Ca alloys. Increasing the Si content in Al led to an increase in the bulk and surface porosity of the coatings. The & alpha;-Al2O3 phase mainly formed in the coatings synthesized on pure Al and Al-Ca alloys, while an increased amount of Si in Al alloys hindered the formation of the & alpha;-Al2O3 phase. The coatings had a microhardness of 660-1180 HV, which was 20-30 times higher than that of the original as-cast alloy. Moreover, the coating on the Al-Ca alloys had the highest peak hardness, which was probably caused by the formation of a greater amount of the & alpha;-Al2O3 phase.

I.";;;Comparative Heat-Resistance Investigation of Protective Coatings;RUSSIAN METALLURGY;;;English;Article;;;;;;"heat resistance; crack; protective coating; life; working blade";;Since modern gas turbine engines operate under changing temperature load conditions, one of the important characteristics of the protective coatings on turbine blades is their high resistance to the appearance and development of cracks under mechanical and thermal loads. The effective internal heat removal systems used to cool turbine blades lead to an increase in their thermal stress. Currently, the cracks induced by thermal fatigue are one of the common defects in the protective coatings on turbine blades. The heat resistance of the coatings at high temperatures is determined by the following three factors: the shape of the part onto which a coating is applied, the coating thickness, and the phase composition of the surface layers or the maximum aluminum content in the coating. Therefore, when a protective coating is chosen under specific operating conditions, it is important to know the influence of these factors on the heat resistance of the coating. In this work, we compare various coatings in terms of their resistance to cracking during cyclic temperature changes. The dependence of the heat resistance of the coatings on the method of their application and the phase-structural state is established. The revealed mechanism of thermal-fatigue crack formation and propagation as a function of the phase composition of the initial coating is especially valuable. The life of the protective coatings under cyclic temperature changes is shown to depend on the chemical composition of the coating and the method of its formation. The dependence of formation of thermal-fatigue cracks on samples with the coatings under study on the number of temperature change cycles is found.;"[Zorichev, A.

The aim of the study is to analyze the peculiarities of the course of mental processes and to identify their relationship with the technical readiness of basketball players at the training stage of preparation. To assess mental processes, we used: a proofreading test, a test with a school ruler, an individual minute, and a tapping test. Standards were used to check technical readiness: the number of hits from 10 free throws, the time of the throw-in motion, and the total number of hits in the ring, shuttle running with ball driving (5x10). The study involved girls aged 15-16 years who had been playing basketball for at least 5 years and had sports grades. The basketball players were examined in September 2021 and May 2022. In this study we found statistical differences between the initial and final levels in terms of the number of errors in the proofreading test (27.91%, p<0.05), the reaction rate to a moving object (27.57%, p<0.05), the duration of the individual minute (13.59%, p<0.05), the result of the tapping test with the right and left hands (the differences were 21.82%, 15.46%, respectively, p<0.05), as well as the coefficient of functional asymmetry (35.67%, p<0.05).

The study is aimed at finding affordable approaches for the shaping of two different narrow-fraction fillers: F240 electro-corundum and hollow alumina microspheres. The results revealed the influence of accessible shaping techniques (semi-dry pressing, direct casting, and slip casting) on the structural and mechanical properties of porous alumina ceramics. The starting materials were characterized by XRD, SEM, EDX, and BET. The manufactured ceramics were studied in terms of microstructure, density, porosity, and flexural strength. Free stacking of the fillers' particles during the direct and slip casting resulted in a higher porosity of ceramics compared with that of semi-dry pressing, while reducing its mechanical strength. Direct casting appeared preferable for ceramics with hollow microspheres because it maintained the integrity of the filler particles and preserved their inherent porosity in the ceramics. The optimal parameters for porous ceramics processing were determined as follows: pressing at 30 MPa and sintering at 1280-1320 degrees C with a bentonite content of 15 wt.%. In this case, the average density and open porosity of F240 samples reached 2.22 g cm(-3) and 40.4%, while samples containing hollow microspheres reached 2.20 g cm(-3) and 36.7%, respectively.;"[Smirnov, Aleksey D.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Ctr Collect Usage High Tech Chem Technol, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Kholodkova, Anastasia A.] Moscow MV Lomonosov State Univ, Chem Dept, Moscow 119991, Russia; [Rybalchenko, Viktor V.; Tarasovskii, Vadim P.] MIREA Russian Technol Univ, Mobile Solut Engn Ctr, Moscow 119454, Russia";"Moscow Polytechnic University; Lomonosov Moscow State University; MIREA - Russian Technological University";Kholodkova, AA (corresponding author), Moscow MV Lomonosov State Univ, Chem Dept, Moscow 119991, Russia.;anastasia.kholodkoval@gmail.com;Kholodkova, Anastasia A/M-2169-2016;;;;;;59;1;1;2;4;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;2571-6131;;;CERAMICS-BASEL;Ceramics-Switzerland;MAR;2023;6;1;;;;;132;145;;10.3390/ceramics6010009;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ceramics6010009;;;14;"Materials Science, Ceramics; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary";Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI);Materials Science;A3NQ3;;gold;;;2024-04-12;WOS:000954236800001;View Full Record in Web of Science

This problem is relevant for rolling mills, which provide the output and determine the quality of products of metallurgical companies. Making up monitoring systems requires the development of digital shadows and coordinate observers, the direct measurement of which is either impossible or associated with numerous difficulties. These coordinates include the spindle torque applied by the spring-transmitting torque from the motor to the rolling stand rolls. The development and research are conducted by the example of the electromechanical systems of the horizontal stand at the plate mill 5000. The stand electric drive characteristics are given, and the emergency modes that cause mechanical equipment breakdowns are analyzed that. The relevance of analyzing transient torque processes in emergency modes has been accentuated. The paper points to the shortcomings of the system for elastic torque direct measurement, including low durability due to the harsh operating conditions of precision sensors. It also highlights the need to install the measuring equipment after each spindle. The disadvantage of the previously developed observer is the function of calculating the electric drive speed derivative. This causes a decrease in noise immunity and signal recovery accuracy. The contribution of this paper is building a digital elastic torque observer that has advantages over conventional technical solutions, based on the theoretical and experimental studies. The technique for virtual observer adjustment was developed and tested in the Matlab-Simulink software package. For the first time, a comprehensive analysis was conducted for spindle elastic torques in emergency modes that caused equipment damage. An algorithm was developed for an emergency shutdown of a stand electric drive in the worst-case mode of strip retraction between work and backup rolls, due to the overlap of the strip on the roll. Further, the algorithm was tested experimentally. The criteria for diagnosing pre-emergencies was then justified. An adaptive motor-braking rate controller was developed. The developed observer and emergency braking system are in operation at the mill 5000. Long experimental research proved the efficiency of dynamic load monitoring and the reduction in the number of equipment breakdowns.;"[Gasiyarov, Vadim R.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Automation & Control, 38, Bolshaya Semyonovskaya Str, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Radionov, Andrey A.; Karandaev, Alexander S.; Khramshin, Vadim R.] Nosov Magnitogorsk State Tech Univ, Power Engn & Automated Syst Inst, 38, Lenin Ave, Magnitogorsk 455000, Russia; [Loginov, Boris M.] South Ural State Univ, Dept Mechatron & Automation, Chelyabinsk 454080, Russia; [Gasiyarova, Olga A.] LLC NPP Uchtekh Profi, Dept Mat Sci, 147, Kommuny Str, Chelyabinsk 454080, Russia";"Moscow Polytechnic University; Nosov Magnitogorsk State Technical University; South Ural State University";Radionov, AA (corresponding author), Nosov Magnitogorsk State Tech Univ, Power Engn & Automated Syst Inst, 38, Lenin Ave, Magnitogorsk 455000, Russia.;radionov.mail@gmail.com;"Radionov, Andrey/P-4418-2015; Khramshin, Vadim/A-6471-2014; Karandaev, Alexander Sergeevich/I-5687-2014; Gasiyarov, Vadim/D-5003-2015";"Radionov, Andrey/0000-0002-3914-4429; Khramshin, Vadim/0000-0003-0972-2803; Karandaev, Alexander Sergeevich/0000-0002-2671-0241; Loginov, Boris/0000-0003-3337-3148; Gasiyarov, Vadim/0000-0001-9635-4716";;;;;81;1;1;6;8;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;2504-4494;;J MANUF MATER PROC;J.

The paper describes the failure and degradation models of complex technical systems assuming monotonic and non-monotonic diffusion distributions, as well as a failure and degradation model of these systems assuming a three-parameter diffusion distribution. Failure and degradation models are proposed to be used together with the classical model of E. Sychev and more complex models created on its basis. In addition, a set of models representing the operation of complex technical systems was developed. The first model is designed for systems whose service life is fully recovered during repair and is described by a system of 21st-order linear algebraic equations, with four degrees (groups) of system degradation taken into account. A functional dependence of steady-state availability on the verification intervals of measuring instruments is plotted for complex technical systems from different degradation groups. Described by a system of 24th-order linear algebraic equations, the second operation model of complex technical systems, whose service life cannot be fully recovered during repair, enables the representation of the main stages in the lifecycle of a pool of complex technical systems, which includes pool upgrade through the procurement of new and modernization of existing systems. The developed operation models provide a means to calculate the optimal intervals between verifications and tolerances for the monitored parameters in different degradation groups of complex technical systems, thus ensuring maximum steady-state availability. These models can be used to classify complex technical systems in order to establish requirements for their metrological support, as well as to calculate technical and economic development indicators for a pool of such systems. The proposed models also provide the basis for a set of applied programs designed to model and optimize stages in its lifecycle.;"[Ershov, D. S.; Malakhov, A.

One way to solve these problems is to develop original packaging with protection elements and labeling against counterfeiting, which excludes the possibility of replication and forgery by printing or other methods. The most reliable way to protect packaging from counterfeiting is the use of new materials with unique optical properties and constantly updated technologies for packaging manufacturing and labeling. This paper proposes a new multi-level technology for the design, manufacture and hidden labeling of polymer packaging made from several layers of transparent polymer films. The design and marking of the multilayer films are combined with perforation, thermal treatment and heat sealing of the package. The reliability of the proposed markings is based on the characterization of optical pleochroism effects in transparent multilayer polymer materials with shape memory. The thermomechanical and optical properties of films made of bulk thermoplastics (polypropylene, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride and polyethylene) were characterized in polarized light. The modification and combination of these films provide a high color difference and sufficient contrast of hidden markings, allowing to identify genuine products by bar codes formed from shape memory films in sealing seams of flexible polymer packaging.;"[Kondratov, Alexander P.; Nikolaev, Alexander A.; Nazarov, Victor G.; Vereshchagin, Vladislav Y.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Incognit Technol, Moscow, Russia; [Volinsky, Alex A.] Univ S Florida, Dept Mech Engn, Tampa, FL USA; [Volinsky, Alex A.] Univ S Florida, Dept Mech Engn, 4202 E Fowler Ave ENG030, Tampa, FL 33620 USA";"Moscow Polytechnic University; State University System of Florida; University of South Florida; State University System of Florida; University of South Florida";Volinsky, AA (corresponding author), Univ S Florida, Dept Mech Engn, 4202 E Fowler Ave ENG030, Tampa, FL 33620 USA.;volinsky@usf.edu;"Nikolaev, Alexander/AHB-3757-2022; Nazarov, Victor/B-2274-2014; Vereshchagin, Vladislav/G-3817-2018";"Nikolaev, Alexander/0000-0003-3232-6753; Volinsky, Alex/0000-0002-8520-6248; Vereshchagin, Vladislav/0000-0002-1344-4888";Moscow Polytechnic University;Moscow Polytechnic University;This work was supported by the Moscow Polytechnic University within the grant named after Vladimir Fortov.;;59;0;0;11;21;WILEY;HOBOKEN;111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA;0021-8995;1097-4628;;J APPL POLYM SCI;J.

Metallurgical plants require a solution to implement in the rolling mill retrofitting. A conceptual approach to the virtual configuration of industrial mechatronic complexes based on object-oriented digital twins-prototypes and twins-instances of electromechanical and hydraulic systems is justified. Alternative options for virtual commissioning (VC) were considered, and the Hardware-In-The-Loop (HIL) option was adopted, involving the implementation of DTs in the hardware and software of a programmable logic controller (PLC). Virtual models were built, and control algorithms were tested in the Matlab Simulink software; the prospect of using Simscape domains was noted. The paper's contribution is the description of a methodology for the development of object-oriented DTs, interlinked in the process, exemplified by a rolling mill coiler. The results of the control over the 'virtual reeling' mode are provided; the adequacy of real and virtual processes is confirmed. The problem of developing DTs for a coiler group, solved herein, is a fragment of a large-scale scientific and practical problem of developing DTAs (digital twin aggregates) for interconnected mechatronic rolling mill complexes.

However, achieving a balance between strength and functional properties remains a significant challenge in Mg alloys community. Typically, strength depends on the pinning effect of defects, such as solute atoms and second phases, which hinder dislocation motion. On the other hand, optimal functional properties usually necessitate relative perfect crystal structures, as the presence of solute atoms and second phases can have adverse effects on damping capacity and thermal conductivity. Balancing these conflicting requirements is difficult. The trade-off between strength and functional properties of the Mg alloys should be broken to meet the urgent need in aerospace, automotive, 3C (computers, communications, and consumer electronics) and energy industries for high performance structural-functional integrated Mg-based materials. This review summarizes recent progress in understanding the mechanisms and influencing factors for the functional properties of Mg alloys. The mechanisms underlying the trade-off between strength and functional properties of Mg alloys is discussed. The latest developed structural-functional integrated Mg alloys and their composites are summarized, including high strength Mg-based materials with high damping capacity / high thermal conductivity / strong electromagnetic shielding capability / excellent flame-resistance / high dissolution rate. The future works of developing structure-function integrated Mg-based materials are proposed. (c) 2023 Chongqing University.

To determine the optimal approach to managing education's development in the social investment model of Russia's economic growth with alternative mechanisms of standardization and deregulation. The results of the research show that absolute standardization, as well as absolute deregulation of higher education, does not allow achieving significant results in the sphere of increase in quality of life in Russia. The determined and substantiated optimal scenario of managing the development of higher education in Russia to increase the quality of life envisages a foundation on a flexible approach, which envisages the combination of standardization and deregulation. It is recommended to entirely refuse branches in favor of main universities, refuse government financing in favor of fee-based education and refuse diversification of education forms in favor of the intramural form of study. This allows raising the quality of life by 13.26% (up to 70.87 points).

With the increase of Mn content from 0.4 wt. % to 1.2 wt. %, the volume fraction of dynamically recrystallized (DRXed) grains decreases from 89% to 40%, while the DRXed grain size decreases from 3.2 mu m to 1.9 mu m. The segregation of Mn atoms and nano alpha-Mn dynamical precipitates are observed at the grain boundaries of the extruded Mg-0.8Mn alloys and the amount of dynamically precipitates is increased with increasing Mn content. Tensile tests show that the Mn content significantly affects mechanical properties at room temperature (RT). The Mg-0.8 wt. % Mn alloy shows the excellent ductility of 81 % at room temperature in a strain rate of 1 center dot 10(-3) s(-1), the ductility decreases if the Mn content is lower or higher than 0.8 wt. %. The yield strength (YS) and ultimate tensile strength (UTS) increase with increasing Mn content. The large value of strain rate sensitivity exponent (m-value) and small activation volume (V*) of the as-extruded Mg-0.8Mn alloy suggest that grain boundary sliding (GBS) plays an important role in tensile plastic deformation. High volume fraction of the un-DRXed region leads to the reduced contribution of GBS to plastic deformation, decreases ductility at RT. The Atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis indicates that the contribution of GBS to the total plastic deformation is 2.7 %, 55.1 % and 12.8 % for Mg-0.4Mn, Mg-0.8Mn and Mg-1.2Mn alloys, respectively.;"[Li, C.

The structure of the cast alloy mainly consists of two [(Al) + AlCaCu] and [(Al) + (Al,Cu)(4)Ca + AlCaCu] eutectics. HPT with three revolutions leads to the formation mainly of the submicrocrystalline structure, refining eutectic particles, their more homogeneous distribution in the sample bulk, segregation of calcium from AlCuCa and (Al,Cu)(4)Ca particles, and supersaturation of (Al) solid solution with copper. Such a structure causes strengthening of the alloy by three and a half times but also leads to its embrittlement. Subsequent annealing at 400 degrees C allows an adequate strength-to-plasticity balance to be reached.;"[Rogachev, S. O.; Naumova, E. A.; Tabachkova, N. Yu.; Ten, D. V.; Sundeev, R.

Nevertheless, the fact that there are a large number of working conditions, and the ongoing development of science and technology, require continuous improvement and specification of the models intended for crushing processes and those of the devices concerned. However, there are few studies related to single-roll gyratory crushers. Such crushers are promising for use in mines to crush rocks laid in the developed space. Mathematical modeling and optimization of the design parameters of the working chamber and the executive body (roll) of a single-roll gyratory shaft crusher, designed for crushing strong rocks, was performed in this paper. A differential equation was derived. As a result of its solution, the rational shape of the working chamber cheek of the single-roll gyratory crusher was established, representing a logarithmic spiral arc. Analytical expressions were derived to determine the rational rotation speed and productivity of the crusher under consideration. Expressions for calculating the kinematic load components acting on the roll were formulated. They are the periodic functions of the shaft rotation angle. The Fourier series expansion showed that the loads contained harmonics of the first, second, third and fourth orders. Using the concept of fuzzy sets, a multi-criteria optimization of the design parameters of the working chamber was performed, including the values of the eccentricity and the central angle of the beginning of the cheek profile. The variation coefficients of the kinematic components of the loads acting on the working body reduced, due to the optimal choice of the working chamber profile and the angular coordinates of the installation of the fixed cheeks. The torque reduced 1.67 times, while the radial load decreased 1.2 times.;"[Kondrakhin, Vitalii P.] Russian Acad Sci, Sci Dept, Kh Ibragimov Complex Inst, Staropromyslovskoe Ave 21 A, Grozny 364906, Russia; [Martyushev, Nikita V.] Tomsk Polytech Univ, Dept Mat Sci, 30 Lenin Ave, Tomsk 634050, Russia; [Klyuev, Roman V.; Qi, Mengxu] Moscow Polytech Univ, Tech & Technol Min & Oil & Gas Prod Dept, 33 B Semenovskaya Str, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Sorokova, Svetlana N.; Efremenkov, Egor A.] Tomsk Polytech Univ, Dept Mech Engn, 30 Lenin Ave, Tomsk 634050, Russia; [Valuev, Denis V.] Tomsk Polytech Univ, Yurga Technol Inst Branch, 26 Leningradskaya St, Yurga 652055, Russia";"Russian Academy of Sciences; Ibragimov Complex Research Institute; Tomsk Polytechnic University; Moscow Polytechnic University; Tomsk Polytechnic University; Tomsk Polytechnic University";Martyushev, NV (corresponding author), Tomsk Polytech Univ, Dept Mat Sci, 30 Lenin Ave, Tomsk 634050, Russia.;"vkondrakhin52@mail.ru; martjushev@tpu.ru; kluev-roman@rambler.ru";"Efremenkov, Egor Alekseevich/F-1420-2014; Klyuev, Roman/J-8000-2014; Valuev, Denis Viktorovich/JKJ-3890-2023; Klyuev, Roman Vladimirovich/AAX-6549-2021; Mengxu, Qi/JKI-9975-2023; Martyushev, Nikita/AAO-2653-2020";"Efremenkov, Egor Alekseevich/0000-0001-6617-9152; Klyuev, Roman/0000-0003-3777-7203; Valuev, Denis Viktorovich/0000-0001-5131-8754; Klyuev, Roman Vladimirovich/0000-0003-3777-7203; Martyushev, Nikita/0000-0003-0620-9561";;;;;30;8;8;2;13;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;2227-7390;;MATHEMATICS-BASEL;Mathematics;MAY 17;2023;11;10;;;;;;;2345;10.3390/math11102345;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/math11102345;;;16;Mathematics;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Mathematics;H8AX1;;gold;;;2024-04-12;WOS:000998135900001;View Full Record in Web of Science

A reference trajectory of the robot's movement is needed to estimate errors and evaluate a quality of the localization. In this article, we propose the Prior Distribution Refinement method for generating a reference trajectory of a mobile robot with the Monte Carlo-based localization system. The proposed approach can be applied for both indoor and outdoor environments of an arbitrary size without the need for expensive position tracking sensors or intervention in the testing infrastructure. The reference trajectory is generated by running the algorithm over a so-called Particles' Transition Graph, obtained from a resampling stage of Monte Carlo localization. The prior distribution of particles is then refined by forward-backward propagation through the graph and exploring the connections between particles. The Viterbi algorithm is applied afterwards to generate a reference trajectory based on refined particles' distribution. We demonstrate that such an approach is capable of generating accurate estimates of a mobile robot's position and orientation with the only requirement of moderate quality of localization system being used as a core algorithm for iterative optimization.;"[Griguletskii, Mark; Shipitko, Oleg; Abramov, Maxim; Pristanskiy, Egor; Kibalov, Vladislav; Grigoryev, Anton] Evocargo LLC, Moscow 129085, Russia; [Shipitko, Oleg; Abramov, Maxim; Kibalov, Vladislav; Grigoryev, Anton] RAS, Inst Informat Transmiss Problems IITP, Moscow 127051, Russia; [Griguletskii, Mark] Skolkovo Inst Sci & Technol, Moscow 121205, Russia; [Pristanskiy, Egor] Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Appl Math & Comp Sci, Moscow 121205, Russia";"Russian Academy of Sciences; Skolkovo Institute of Science & Technology; Moscow Polytechnic University";"Griguletskii, M (corresponding author), Evocargo LLC, Moscow 129085, Russia.;Griguletskii, M (corresponding author), Skolkovo Inst Sci & Technol, Moscow 121205, Russia.";mark.griguletskii@skoltech.ru;;;EVOCARGO LLC;EVOCARGO LLC;This work was supported by the EVOCARGO LLC.;;32;0;1;2;6;IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC;PISCATAWAY;445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA;2169-3536;;;IEEE ACCESS;IEEE Access;;2023;11;;;;;;19093;19102;;10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3247503;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3247503;;;10;"Computer Science, Information Systems; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Telecommunications";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Computer Science; Engineering; Telecommunications";9M5DV;;gold;;;2024-04-12;WOS:000942251100001;View Full Record in Web of Science

An environmentally friendly technology for the recycling of CPSs by multi-stage methods developed at the National Research Center Kurchatov Institute - IREA is presented. The technology involves opening, crushing, and grinding (with mechanical activation), followed by liquid-solid leaching and liquid-liquid extraction. The target product is a powdery precipitate containing compounds of cobalt (Co), lithium (Li), manganese (Mn), nickel (Ni), etc. The grinding stage (in a ball mill or a disintegrator) leads to the destruction of the particle structure, changing their specific surface area and porosity. As a result, the intensity and efficiency of the extraction processes increase. The textural characteristics (such as specific surface area, porosity, total pore volume, micro- and mesopore volume) of crushed and powdered samples containing graphite with inclusions of Co and Li compounds are determined. The methods implemented in the Micromeritics ASAP 2020 analyzer software such as BET, t-Plot, Dubinin-Radushkevich, Dubinin-Astakhov, Horvath-Kawazoe, and BJH are used. The calculated texture characteristics can be used to optimize the extraction of the target components from a mechanically activated powder during leaching followed by extraction.;"[Nazarov, V.

Ingots of the alloy of the chosen composition and the hot and cold rolled sheets obtained from them were used as objects for the experimental study. Based on microstructural studies, it is shown that calcium binds iron into compact inclusions (presumably, into the Al10CaFe2 phases), which has a positive effect on the mechanical properties of the alloy, as well as on the technological plasticity during the rolling operation. Zirconium and scandium additives make it possible to form thermally stable nanoparticles of the Al-3(Zr, Sc)-L1(2) phase, which is favorable for maintaining a partially unrecrystallized structure in cold rolled sheets during annealing at least up to 400 degrees C.

It was found that the supramolecular structure of the films is a three-dimensional network composed of orientationally ordered microfibrils with an average diameter from 30 to 60 nm, which consist of crystalline and amorphous regions. An analysis of the powder X-ray diffraction patterns demonstrated that the crystalline regions of microfibrils are formed by cellulose I. Depending on the composition of the nutrient medium, the degree of crystallinity of the films varies in the range from similar to 20 to 90%. It was found that, regardless of the carbon source, the top and bottom surfaces of BC films have different microstructures defined by static conditions of cultivation. Thus, the top surface of gel films contains pores with a diameter of up to 500 nm, whereas a wider pore size distribution (up to 600 nm) is observed on the bottom surface. The difference between the average pore sizes on the top and bottom surfaces varies from 95 to 180 nm and from 100 to 200 nm, respectively. The measurements of the mechanical properties of the films showed that the films produced by the cultivation on media containing fructose and sucrose have the maximum strength, whereas the films produced using lactose and maltose have the minimum strength. The data on the BC productivity of the GH-1/2008 strain were obtained.;"[Bolgova, A. L.; Gromovykh, T. I.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Shevtsov, A.

The use of complementary x-ray diffraction and analysis of neutron diffraction patterns by the Rietveld method allowed reliably separating the nuclear and magnetic contributions to the intensity of the diffraction peaks and performing refinement of the Fe3Ge magnetic state characteristics. Both main phases appearing in Fe3Ge are ferromagnetic with T-C = 629 K (hexagonal, D0(19)) and T-C = 714 K (cubic, L-12). In D0(19), the presence of a spin-flip transition (T-sf = 385 K) was confirmed and the temperature dependence of the components of magnetic moment along the hexagonal axis and in the basal plane was obtained. It was shown that the transformation between ordered L1(2) and D0(19) structural states, predicted by the equilibrium-phase diagram, includes three steps: two diffusional stages (L1(2) -> A1, A3 -> D0(19)) and one displacive stage (A1 -> A3). The obtained structural data suggest that in Fe-Ge, as well as in Fe-Ga alloy, direct transitions between ordered phases are impossible. They should include a transition between disordered states.;"[Balagurov, Anatoly M.; Samoylova, Nataliya Yu.; Sumnikov, Sergey V.; Palacheva, Valeria V.; Golovin, Igor S.] Joint Inst Nucl Res, Dubna 141980, Russia; [Balagurov, Anatoly M.; Sumnikov, Sergey V.; Palacheva, Valeria V.; Golovin, Igor S.] Natl Univ Sci & Technol MISIS, Moscow 119049, Russia; [Balagurov, Anatoly M.] Lomonosov Moscow State Univ, Moscow 119991, Russia; [Golovin, Igor S.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Moscow 107023, Russia";"Joint Institute for Nuclear Research - Russia; National University of Science & Technology (MISIS); Lomonosov Moscow State University; Moscow Polytechnic University";"Balagurov, AM (corresponding author), Joint Inst Nucl Res, Dubna 141980, Russia.;Balagurov, AM (corresponding author), Natl Univ Sci & Technol MISIS, Moscow 119049, Russia.;Balagurov, AM (corresponding author), Lomonosov Moscow State Univ, Moscow 119991, Russia.";;Golovin, Igor S./O-3251-2013;"Golovin, Igor S./0000-0001-5557-2979; Balagurov, Anatoly/0000-0002-5498-6405; Samoylova, Nataliya/0000-0002-0607-804X";Russian Science Foundation [22-42-04404];Russian Science Foundation(Russian Science Foundation (RSF));The ND experiments were carried out using the IBR-2 (FLNP JINR) neutron source.

The interference, that is, the transfer of language units of all language levels (phonetics, vocabulary, morphology, syntax) of the native language to the target language, can be called a specific feature. Particular attention is paid to the difficulties the students face due to the lack of linguistic phenomena or mismatch between them (for example, the lack of certain sounds, mismatch of the lexical meaning of homonymic words and different sentence construction). In order to achieve the effectiveness of the educational process, it is necessary to study some methods and means that facilitate the mastering of non-native linguistic phenomena. The authors of the article come to the following conclusions: teachers should have certain linguistic knowledge of the native language of students; in the lessons, it is preferable to pay particular attention to the phenomena that are absent in the native language; in the course of education, it is necessary to carry out systematic work to eliminate difficulties at all language levels.";"[Platonova, Elena; Panova, Elena; Lobanova, Julia] Moscow Polytech Univ, Moscow, Russia; [Gulyaeva, Evgenia] Russian Presidential Acad Natl Econ & Publ Adm, Volgograd Inst Management Branch, Moscow, Russia; [Bubekova, Larisa] Kazan Fed Univ, Kazan, Russia; [Tereshchenko, Olesya] Kuban State Agr Univ, Krasnodar, Russia";"Moscow Polytechnic University; Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy & Public Administration; Kazan Federal University; Kuban State Agrarian University";Platonova, E (corresponding author), Moscow Polytech Univ, Moscow, Russia.;"elena_platonova_85@mail.ru; evgulyaeva@gmail.com; panova_ep@mail.ru; julia-lobanova@mail.ru; bubekova.l.b@yandex.ru; olesya.tereschenko@yandex.ru";;;;;;;13;0;0;0;0;UNIV CIENFUEGOS;CIENFUEGOS;CARRETERA RODAS KM 4, CUATRO CAMINOS, CIENFUEGOS, 00000, CUBA;1990-8644;;;REV CONRADO;REV.

In this case, the territory subject to exogenous processes is likened to a nonequilibrium, open thermodynamic system. To successfully apply the synergetic approach to natural phenomena, a comprehensive study of the degree of influence of each of the factors acting on the system under consideration on the processes occurring in it is required. Therefore, in this work, the main attention is paid to the dynamics of the development of exogenous processes in the southeastern part of the Chechen Republic, subject to exogenous processes. It is shown that these processes are cyclical in nature and cause enormous harm to the economy and population of the region. The geodynamic processes that arise during long-term development of oil and gas fields are also considered. This work can be considered as a preparatory stage for the study of these phenomena based on a synergetic approach. It is expected that these studies can become the basis for systematization, theoretical generalization of the results obtained and the development of methods for predicting natural processes.;"[Daukaev, A.

The modeling of metal leaching processes using mechanical activation of polymetallic raw material components is particularly important in expanding the application of mining tailings as inert fillers of filling mixtures. This study is aimed at detecting the rotor speed factor on the chemical and mechanochemical effect of zinc yield growth from polymetallic tailings of the mining industry. In this regard, the purpose of this study was to improve the modeling of metal leaching processes using mechanical activation by improving the compositions of the filling mixtures. The methodology of the work included several comprehensive studies: the mechanical activation of tailings during zinc leaching from pulp in the DESI-11 disintegrator; the activation of enrichment tailings and the formation of a filling mass with different parameters of the component composition; the curing of cubic samples and their testing on the IP-1250 press. The Vi Improved text editor was used to prepare the algorithms for deterministic methods of three-dimensional interpolation in the Python language. The experimental results were graphically displayed using Gnuplot. The study of the agitation leaching of the waste obtained from the Sadonskiy mining district results in the fact that the NaCl mass concentration decreased from 13 to 1% and the H2SO4 concentration stabilization within 0.5 to 0.6% led to a 3-time increase in the zinc yield from the pulp, according to the polynomial law (from 28 to 91%). The obtained results expand the idea of the mechanism of the strength gain by the filling mass under mechanical activation on the components of the filling mixture, as well as changes in the efficiency of zinc leaching at different ratios of two types of lixiviants (sulphuric acid and sodium chloride) in the leaching solution.";"[Golik, Vladimir I.; Klyuev, Roman V.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Tech & Technol Min & Oil & Gas Prod, 38,B Semenovskaya St, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Martyushev, Nikita V.; Mengxu, Qi] Tomsk Polytech Univ, Dept Mat Sci, 30,Lenin Ave, Tomsk 634050, Russia; [Brigida, Vladimir] Russian Acad Sci, Fed Res Ctr Subtrop Sci Ctr, 2 28,Yana Fabritsiusa St, Soci 354002, Russia; [Brigida, Vladimir] RUDN Univ, PeoplesFriendship Univ Russia, Dept Biomed Vet & Ecol Direct, 6,Miklukho Maklaya St, Moscow 117198, Russia; [Efremenkov, Egor A.; Sorokova, Svetlana N.] Tomsk Polytech Univ, Dept Mech Engn, 30,Lenin Ave, Tomsk 634050, Russia";"Moscow Polytechnic University; Tomsk Polytechnic University; Russian Academy of Sciences; Peoples Friendship University of Russia; Tomsk Polytechnic University";Martyushev, NV (corresponding author), Tomsk Polytech Univ, Dept Mat Sci, 30,Lenin Ave, Tomsk 634050, Russia.;"v.i.golik@mail.ru; kluev-roman@rambler.ru; martjushev@tpu.ru; 1z011@inbox.ru; egorefr@tpu.ru; s_sorokova@tpu.ru; mensyuy1@tpu.ru";"Klyuev, Roman/J-8000-2014; Mengxu, Qi/JKI-9975-2023; Klyuev, Roman Vladimirovich/AAX-6549-2021; Golik, Vladimir Ivanovich/K-3731-2018; Brigida, Vladimir/G-6933-2018; Efremenkov, Egor Alekseevich/F-1420-2014; Martyushev, Nikita/AAO-2653-2020";"Klyuev, Roman/0000-0003-3777-7203; Klyuev, Roman Vladimirovich/0000-0003-3777-7203; Brigida, Vladimir/0000-0002-9421-5613; Efremenkov, Egor Alekseevich/0000-0001-6617-9152; Martyushev, Nikita/0000-0003-0620-9561";;;;;49;27;27;5;9;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;1996-1944;;MATERIALS;Materials;JAN;2023;16;2;;;;;;;726;10.3390/ma16020726;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ma16020726;;;15;"Chemistry, Physical; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering; Physics, Applied; Physics, Condensed Matter";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Chemistry; Materials Science; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering; Physics";8Q5OM;36676461;Green Published, gold;;;2024-04-12;WOS:000927256200001;View Full Record in Web of Science

It proposes a new probe-coil magnetic-field NDT, not requiring the pre-magnetization of the test object material, which is mandatory for all conventional magnetic flaw detection techniques. A new bifactor excitation of the fluxgate sensor's sensitive element, based on double mu-transformation through the simultaneous activation of magnetic-modulating and electromagnetic-acoustic effects, is theoretically justified. The physical processes underlying the proposed technique are considered in detail, and a scheme for its practical implementation is described. The authors provide a variant of the new fluxgate's original design, implementing the proposed excitation technique. The specifics of implementing the fluxgate operating modes are analyzed, testifying to the possibility of detecting a given class of flaws with the required coverage as well as ensuring the required diagnostic resolution during flaw detection, which, in fact, indicates a more reliable identification of both the flaw type and location. Herewith, the new fluxgate type features the advantages of improved functionality and lower cost due to its simple design. The paper also considers a method to experimentally study the capabilities of the proposed fluxgate sensor with a new bifactor excitation in detail.

However, due to the openness and vulnerability of wireless networks, the participating vehicles in a VANET system are prone to a variety of cyberattacks. To secure the privacy of vehicles and assure the authenticity, integrity, and nonrepudiation of messages, numerous signature schemes have been employed in the literature on VANETs. The majority of these solutions, however, are either not fully secured or entail high computational costs. To address the above issues and to enable secure communication between the vehicle and the roadside unit (RSU), we propose a certificateless aggregate signature (CLAS) scheme based on hyperelliptic curve cryptography (HECC). This scheme enables participating vehicles to share their identities with trusted authorities via an open wireless channel without revealing their identities to unauthorized participants. Another advantage of this approach is its capacity to release the partial private key to participating devices via an open wireless channel while keeping its identity secret from any other third parties. A provable security analysis through the random oracle model (ROM), which relies on the hyperelliptic curve discrete logarithm problem, is performed, and we have proven that the proposed scheme is unforgeable against Type 1 (??????(1)) and Type 2 (??????(2)) forgers. The proposed scheme is compared with relevant schemes in terms of computational cost and communication overhead, and the results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is more efficient than the existing schemes in maintaining high-security levels.;"[Iqbal, Asad; Zubair, Muhammad; Ur-Rehman, Ghani] Khushal Khan Khattak Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Karak 27200, Pakistan; [Khan, Muhammad Asghar; Ullah, Insaf] Hamdard Univ, Fac Engn Sci & Technol, Islamabad 44000, Pakistan; [Shvetsov, Alexey V.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Smart Technol, St Bolshaya Semenovskaya 38, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Shvetsov, Alexey V.] North Eastern Fed Univ, Dept Car Transport Operat & Car Serv, St Belinsky 58, Yakutsk 677000, Russia; [Noor, Fazal] Islamic Univ Madinah, Dept Comp & Informat Syst, Madinah 400411, Saudi Arabia";"Hamdard University; Moscow Polytechnic University; North-Eastern Federal University in Yakutsk; Islamic University of Al Madinah";"Shvetsov, AV (corresponding author), Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Smart Technol, St Bolshaya Semenovskaya 38, Moscow 107023, Russia.;Shvetsov, AV (corresponding author), North Eastern Fed Univ, Dept Car Transport Operat & Car Serv, St Belinsky 58, Yakutsk 677000, Russia.;Noor, F (corresponding author), Islamic Univ Madinah, Dept Comp & Informat Syst, Madinah 400411, Saudi Arabia.";"asadiqbal628@gmail.com; dr.muhammadzubair@kkkuk.edu.pk; m.asghar@hamdard.edu.pk; insaf.ullah@hamdard.edu.pk; ghani.rehman@kkkuk.edu.pk; a.shvetsov@vvsu.ru; mfnoor@iu.edu.sa";"Khan, Muhammad Asghar/AAT-3860-2020; Shvetsov, Alexey Vladislavovich/R-2057-2019";"Khan, Muhammad Asghar/0000-0002-1351-898X; Shvetsov, Alexey Vladislavovich/0000-0002-4455-0296; Zubair, Muhammad/0000-0001-6723-5486";;;;;33;1;1;2;2;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;1999-5903;;FUTURE INTERNET;Future Internet;AUG;2023;15;8;;;;;;;266;10.3390/fi15080266;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fi15080266;;;16;Computer Science, Information Systems;Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI);Computer Science;Q3DT0;;gold;;;2024-04-12;WOS:001056358900001;View Full Record in Web of Science

The object of study is a wall with FHIC, on the outer surface of which temperature sensors were mounted and measurements were taken. Air temperatures were also measured for one month of the warm period of the year. The coefficient of absorption of solar radiation by the surface of the facade is calculated based on the measurement of the spectral reflection coefficient. Measurements of direct and scattered solar radiation arriving on a horizontal surface were carried out, and the cloudiness of the sky was also recorded. The calculation of direct and scattered solar radiation was carried out, taking into account the shading of surrounding buildings using the authors' novel methods. The experimental days were divided into three groups according to the degree of cloudiness; statistically significant differences between the groups for the studied parameters were demonstrated. The temperature of the outer surface of the wall was calculated according to A.M. Shklover's formula. The measured values of the temperature of the outer surface of the wall were compared with the calculated ones. It was shown that there is a good correlation between the measured and calculated temperatures for different degrees of cloudiness. At the same time, for days with no or slight cloudiness (Group I), when direct solar radiation predominates, the differences reach 1.7 & DEG;C; smaller differences are observed for days with average cloudiness (Group II) during daytime hours, with a maximum difference of 0.5 & DEG;C; and on days with continuous cloudiness (Group III), when only scattered radiation is present for daytime hours, the maximum difference is 0.3 & DEG;C. Statistically significant differences were found between the measured and calculated temperatures for groups of days, divided by the degree of cloudiness, for the experimental period of a day from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., which indicates the possibility of considering amendments to A.M. Shklover's formula for sunny days. The results of comparing the measured and calculated heating temperatures of the facade surface also indirectly confirm the correctness of the author's calculations of the incoming solar radiation, taking into account the effect of the surrounding buildings. The results obtained can be used to study the inertia and durability of building structures under solar radiation.";"[Korkina, Elena V.; Gorbarenko, Ekaterina V.] Russian Acad Architecture & Construct Sci, Res Inst Bldg Phys, 21 Lokomotivny Proezd, Moscow 127238, Russia; [Korkina, Elena V.; Tyulenev, Matvey D.] Moscow State Univ Civil Engn, Dept Heat & Gas Supply & Ventilat, 26 Yaroslavskoe shosse, Moscow 129337, Russia; [Gorbarenko, Ekaterina V.] Lomonosov Moscow State Univ, Fac Geog, 1 Leninskie Gori, Moscow 119234, Russia; [Voitovich, Elena V.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Ind & Civil Engn, 38 Bolshaya Semyonovskaya St, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Kozhukhova, Natalia I.] Belgorod State Technol Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Mat Technol, 46 Kostukov, Belgorod 308012, Russia";"Moscow State University of Civil Engineering; Lomonosov Moscow State University; Moscow Polytechnic University; Belgorod State Technological University";Kozhukhova, NI (corresponding author), Belgorod State Technol Univ, Dept Mat Sci & Mat Technol, 46 Kostukov, Belgorod 308012, Russia.;"elena.v.korkina@gmail.com; tulenevm@gmail.com; e.voitovich@mail.ru; catgor@mail.ru; kozhuhovanata@yandex.ru";Kozhukhova, Natalia/F-8804-2015;;;;;;21;1;1;0;0;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;1996-1073;;ENERGIES;Energies;AUG;2023;16;15;;;;;;;5783;10.3390/en16155783;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en16155783;;;11;Energy & Fuels;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Energy & Fuels;O8HF1;;gold;;;2024-04-12;WOS:001046156300001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Unfortunately, these properties are lost in thin films due to aggregation quenching effect (ACQ) and internal filter effect, limiting BODIPY application in optical devices. The introduction of bulky substituents into dye molecule should affect the supramolecular organization of BODIPY in thin films. Therefore, using the example of 0-benzyl-substituted complex (1) and bis(BODIPY) dimer (2), we study the influence of bulky substituents at the 0, 0'-positions of these BODIPY molecules on their aggregation behavior in mono-and multilayer Langmuir -Schaefer (LS) films. A comparative analysis of BODIPY spectral properties in LS and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) films has been carried out. It was shown that the presence of bulky benzyl-substituents in 0-positions of pyrrole rings promotes the formation of H-and J-type aggregates in multilayer LS-films of the dye 1 and BODIPY dimer 2. The dye 1 predominantly forms H-type aggregates, while for the dye 2, the equilibrium is shifted towards the formation of J-type aggregates. The studied BODIPYs with a low content of up to 1 wt. % exhibit intense fluorescence being included in PMMA films. The results obtained give the possibility to use more efficiently thin-film structures based on the studied BODIPY thin films in optoelectronics.;"[Sherudillo, A. S.; Antina, L. A.; Berezin, M.

This study is dedicated to filling the gap in revealing the phase composition of an Al-6%Mg-2%Ca-2%Zn alloy after the combined and separate addition of Fe and Si. This was addressed by permanent mold casting and solid solution heat treatment. The investigation of slowly solidified samples also contributed to understanding potential phase transitions. It was found that the alloy containing 0.5%Fe can have nearly spherical intermetallics after heat treatment, whereas a higher Fe content brought the formation of a needle-shaped Al3Fe intermetallic. We explain this by the formation of a ternary & alpha;-Al + Al10CaFe2 + Al4Ca eutectic, which is more compact in as-cast condition compared to divorced binary & alpha;-Al + Al4Ca and & alpha;-Al + Al3Fe eutectics. Similarly, 0.5%Si readily incurred the formation of a needle-shaped Al2CaSi2 intermetallic, probably also by a binary reaction L & RARR; & alpha;-Al + Al2CaSi2. In the solidified samples, no Mg2Si phase was found, even in slowly solidified samples. This is contrary to the thermodynamic calculation, which suggests a peritectic reaction L + Al2CaSi2 Mg2Si. Interestingly, the addition of 0.5%Si caused an even coarser microstructure compared to the addition of 1%Fe, which caused the appearance of a primary Al3Fe phase.

Therefore, this issue has been regulated at the level of by-laws, which contradicts the constitutional order. This concerns both the scope and content of human rights and freedoms, as well as the criteria for their restrictions provided by the Constitution and laws. In practice, the appointment of officials to bodies and institutions will mean reaching a con-sensus since it considers the representation of political forces. Members of such independent bodies and institutions should be appointed for a certain period and have a limited right to hold office.

However, the behavior, oxidation mechanisms, and factors defin-ing oxidation resistance of some popular HECs at high temperatures have not been studied in detail yet. In this study, the oxidation behavior of MEC and HECs including (Ta,Ti,Nb,Zr)C, (Ta,Ti,Nb,Zr,Mo)C, (Ta,Ti, Nb,Zr,Hf)C, and (Ta,Ti,Nb,Zr,W)C was investigated under both non-isothermal and isothermal conditions at temperatures up to 1200 & DEG;C, and a possible oxidation path was described. It was found that under non-isothermal heating conditions, the oxidation of HECs occurred in three stages, each governed by first-order chemical reactions, and was limited by the formation of ZrO2, Me2Me6O17, and MeMe2O7 oxides, respectively. In the case of isothermal heating, the oxidation of (Ta,Ti,Nb,Zr)C, (Ta,Ti,Nb,Zr,Mo)C, and (Ta,Ti,Nb,Zr,Hf)C follows a logarithmic law and was limited by the formation of a protective Me2Me6O17 layer. In contrast, isothermal oxidation of (Ta,Ti,Nb,Zr,W)C followed a linear law due to the formation of volatile WO3. The results of the study have a high potential for practical application for the production of HEC ceramics for various high-temperature purposes and could be used for further understanding of functional characteristics and development of the new ceramic compositions.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s).

A unifying parallel is drawn between resource-dependent countries and regions with depleted mineral resources. The objective factors of losses of accessed reserves are analyzed. A unifying parallel is drawn between sub-standard ores and industrial waste. The paper proposes shifting geotechnology development from simple mineral extraction towards technologies that provide a full cycle of geo-resources development. A radical way of ensuring a full cycle of geo-resources development is the involvement of sub-standard ores and industrial waste in a closed processing cycle. The utilization of industrial waste without a valuable component extracting or reducing a harmful component to a background value is palliative. A comparative description of various technologies that allow extracting valuable components from sub-standard ores and industrial waste is made. The paper proposes a variant of chemical-physical technology that makes it possible to extract a valuable component from industrial waste to a minimum value. The activation of industrial waste with a disintegrator before a chemical extraction significantly increases the yield of a valuable component from 2.6 to 218.5%. A differentiated approach is needed regarding the choice of leaching solution, its percentage, as well as the leaching method and the need for activation processing of valuable components and industrial ones. The combined highly efficient physical-chemical and physical-technical technologies will ensure the maximum extraction of the valuable component from 52.6 to 98.8% in the full cycle of natural and industrial geo-resources development.;"[Kongar-Syuryun, Cheynesh B.] St Petersburg Min Univ, Min Dept, 21st Line 2, St Petersburg 199106, Russia; [Aleksakhin, Alexander V.; Eliseeva, Evgeniya N.] Natl Univ Sci & Technol MISiS, Econ Dept, Leninsky Ave 4, Moscow 119991, Russia; [Zhaglovskaya, Anna V.] Natl Univ Sci & Technol MISiS, Coll Econ & Ind Management, Dept Ind Management, Leninsky Ave 4, Moscow 119991, Russia; [Klyuev, Roman V.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Tech & Technol Min & Oil & Gas Prod, 38 B Semenovskaya St, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Petrusevich, Denis A.] MIREA Russian Technol Univ RTU MIREA, Inst Artificial Intelligence, Higher Math Chair, Vernadsky Ave 78, Moscow 119454, Russia";"Saint Petersburg Mining University; National University of Science & Technology (MISIS); National University of Science & Technology (MISIS); Moscow Polytechnic University; MIREA - Russian Technological University";Kongar-Syuryun, CB (corresponding author), St Petersburg Min Univ, Min Dept, 21st Line 2, St Petersburg 199106, Russia.;kongarsiuriun@gmail.com;"Klyuev, Roman Vladimirovich/AAX-6549-2021; Klyuev, Roman/J-8000-2014";"Klyuev, Roman Vladimirovich/0000-0003-3777-7203; Klyuev, Roman/0000-0003-3777-7203; Petrusevich, Denis/0000-0001-5325-6198";;;;;54;7;7;3;5;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;2079-9276;;RESOURCES-BASEL;Resources-Basel;APR;2023;12;4;;;;;;;50;10.3390/resources12040050;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/resources12040050;;;14;"Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences";Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI);"Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology";E7XP3;;gold;;;2024-04-12;WOS:000977631000001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Materials & methods: For drug-loaded liposome preparation, lipids and drug mixture in organic solvents was injected into copper salt solution, forming a coordination compound simultaneously embedded in the lipid bilayer. In vitro tests were performed on MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Results: Liposomes had a loading capacity of up to 1.75% (molar drug-to-lipid ratio). In vitro tests showed increased viability and accumulation of the liposomal formulation compared with free drug as well as lack of cytotoxicity in hepatocytes. Conclusion: This optimized technique for encapsulating large copper complexes in liposomes could be used to improve their delivery and better treat cancer and bacterial infections. This work introduces a new technique for copper-containing drugs encapsulation in a drug-delivery system. The drug, a promising copper compound, is embedded in lipid nanovesicles - tiny fat particles - for intravenous injection. In addition to chemical characterization of the obtained drug form, tests on cancer cells showed a noticeable effect, whereas healthy cell types were not harmed. Copper possesses not only anticancer effects but also antimicrobial properties, which are also shown by the drug form, and a test of combined suppression of cancer cell lines and bacteria was successful. Hence, the obtained drug form has the potential for dual treatment of cancer and bacterial infections.;"[Iakimova, Tamara M.] Lomonosov Moscow State Univ, Fac Mat Sci, Moscow 119991, Russia; [Iakimova, Tamara M.; Bubley, Anna A.; Boychenko, Olga P.; Guk, Dmitry A.; Vaneev, Alexander N.; Krasnovskaya, Olga O.; Klyachko, Natalia L.; Vlasova, Kseniia Yu] Lomonosov Moscow State Univ, Sch Chem, Moscow 119991, Russia; [Vaneev, Alexander N.; Erofeev, Alexander S.; Gorelkin, Petr, V] Natl Univ Sci & Technol, Res Lab Biophys, Moscow 119049, Russia; [Prusov, Andrey N.] AN Belozersky Res Inst, Moscow 119991, Russia; [Erofeev, Alexander S.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Res Lab Scanning Probe Microscopy, Moscow 107023, Russia";"Lomonosov Moscow State University; Lomonosov Moscow State University; National University of Science & Technology (MISIS); Moscow Polytechnic University";"Klyachko, NL; Vlasova, KY (corresponding author), Lomonosov Moscow State Univ, Sch Chem, Moscow 119991, Russia.";"klyachko@enzyme.chem.msu.ru; vlasovakseniiayurevna@gmail.com";Guk, Dmitry/O-3260-2018;"Guk, Dmitry/0000-0002-5674-8654; Vaneev, Alexander/0000-0001-8201-8498; Iakimova, Tamara/0000-0002-5504-089X; Boychenko, Olga/0000-0001-6246-7085";"Russian Federation Ministry of Education and Science and Research; Russian Science Foundation [19-74-10059]; Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation (Russian Federation Government) [218, 075-11-2022-022]";"Russian Federation Ministry of Education and Science and Research; Russian Science Foundation(Russian Science Foundation (RSF)); Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation (Russian Federation Government)";The authors acknowledge the Shared Facilities Center of Lomonosov Moscow State University sponsored by the Russian Federation Ministry of Education and Science and Research.

There is a downward trend in the ore mining rate, which confirms the expediency of processing substandard ores and disposing accumulated waste. A strategy for restoring the lost potential including the use of metal-leaching technologies is formulated. The advantages of such technologies are characterized. It is pointed out that most of the ore processing waste can be used in production. The results of experiments on brining non-extracted metals into solution are presented. The advantages of leaching in disintegrator mills are shown by comparison with the reference case. Changing the quality of recycled mill tailings makes it possible to implement the principles of resource saving for gaining economic benefits. It is concluded that the recommended technology shows a way of technological diversification of production, tailings can be a cheap and affordable raw material for related industries, and the mechanochemical activation of the leaching process in a disintegrator ensures the recovery of metals from the mill tailings of Sadon polymetallic ores. Quantitative strength characteristics of the hardening mixture as a result of activation by alternative methods are obtained.

Two different scanning strategies were used: the convenient single laser exposure scanning strategy and the newly proposed double scanning strategy aimed at improving the melting process and increasing the density of the synthesized material. Samples with a relative density value higher than 95% were obtained using the new scanning strategy by reducing void volume and cracks. This was achieved by decreasing internal stresses and reducing the tendency to form and propagate cracks. The double scanning strategy of half laser power followed by full power exposure provides higher magnetic properties (both coercive force and remanence). The coercive force increases with energy input decrease, while remanence has inverse dependence.;"[Pelevin, Ivan A.; Terekhin, Egor A.; Ozherelkov, Dmitry Yu.; Tereshina, Irina S.; Chernyshikhin, Stanislav V.; Gromov, Alexander A.] Natl Univ Sci & Technol, Catalysis Lab, MISIS, Moscow 119991, Russia; [Tereshina, Irina S.] Lomonosov Moscow State Univ, Fac Phys, Moscow 119991, Russia; [Karpenkov, Dmitry Yu.] Lomonosov Moscow State Univ, Dept Magnetism, Moscow 119991, Russia; [Bochkanov, Fedor Yu.] Natl Univ Sci & Technol, MISIS, Dept Funct Nanosyst & High Temp Mat, Moscow 119991, Russia; [Chernyshikhin, Stanislav V.] Skolkovo Inst Sci & Technol, Ctr Mat Technol, Moscow 121205, Russia; [Nalivaiko, Anton Yu.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Directorate Sci, Moscow 107023, Russia";"National University of Science & Technology (MISIS); Lomonosov Moscow State University; Lomonosov Moscow State University; National University of Science & Technology (MISIS); Skolkovo Institute of Science & Technology; Moscow Polytechnic University";Pelevin, IA (corresponding author), Natl Univ Sci & Technol, Catalysis Lab, MISIS, Moscow 119991, Russia.;"i.pelevin@misis.ru; terehinegor2016@gmail.com; d.ozherelkov@gmail.com; irina_tereshina@mail.ru; karpenkov_d_y@mail.ru; bochkanov_fy@mail.ru; stanislav.chernyshikhin@skoltech.ru; a.y.nalivajko@mospolytech.ru; a.gromov@misis.ru";"Ozherelkov, Dmitrii/G-6720-2014; Gromov, Alexander/N-1673-2014; Karpenkov, Dmitriy/H-6473-2014";"Ozherelkov, Dmitrii/0000-0003-1553-4526; Gromov, Alexander/0000-0002-2641-2607; Chernyshikhin, Stanislav/0000-0001-7419-9604; Tereshina, Irina/0000-0003-3633-3440; Pelevin, Ivan/0000-0003-1592-3062; Karpenkov, Dmitriy/0000-0001-8686-2303";Russian Science Foundation (RSF) [21-79-10239];Russian Science Foundation (RSF)(Russian Science Foundation (RSF));This research was funded by the Russian Science Foundation (RSF), grant number 21-79-10239.;;37;0;0;3;5;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;2075-4701;;METALS-BASEL;Metals;JUN;2023;13;6;;;;;;;1084;10.3390/met13061084;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/met13061084;;;16;"Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Materials Science; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering";K6IF7;;gold;;;2024-04-12;WOS:001017450100001;View Full Record in Web of Science

For continuous monitoring of the well drilling process, an experimental setup was developed that operates on the basis of the use of the phase-metric method of control. Any movement of the bit causes a change in the electrical characteristics of the probing signal. To obtain a stable signal from a bit immersion depth of up to 250 m, a frequency of probing electrical signals of 166 Hz and an amplitude of up to 500 V were used; sampling rate (analog-to-digital converter) ADC - 10101 Hz. To identify the state of the drill string and the bit according to the graphs of dependences of changes in the electrical characteristics of the probing signal on time, the authors of the article investigated a number of deep learning methods, based on the results of the research, a line of capsule neural network (CapsNet) methods was selected. The authors have developed two modifications of 1D-CapsNet and Windowed Fourier Transform (WFT) - 2D-CapsNet. To identify the transition between two rock layers with different properties, WFT-2D-CapsNet showed an accuracy of 99%, which is 2-3% higher than the results of modern rock studies based on measurement-while-drilling (MWD) and logging-while-drilling (LWD) methods.

For the objective of obtaining balanced performance, experts have suggested the addition of metal particles as supplement to the ceramic reinforcement. Consequently, high-performance metal hybrid composites have been developed. However, achieving the optimal mix for the reinforcement combination with regards to the optimal performance of developed composite remains a challenge. This research aimed to determine the optimal mixture of Al50Cu10Sn5Mg20Zn10Ti5 lightweight high-entropy alloy (LHEA), B4C, and ZrO2 for the fabrication of trihybrid titanium composites via direct laser deposition. A mixture design was involved in the experimental design, and experimental data were modeled and optimized to achieve the optimal performance of the trihybrid composite. The ANOVA, response surface plots, and ternary maps analyses of the experimental results revealed that various combinations of reinforcement particles displayed a variety of response trends. Moreover, the analysis showed that these reinforcements significantly contributed to the magnitudes and trends of the responses.

Within this context, Healthcare 5.0 signifies a holistic approach to healthcare delivery, where interconnected technologies enable data-driven decision-making, patient-centric care, and enhanced efficiency. This paper provides an in-depth exploration of FL's role within the framework of Healthcare 5.0 and its implications for the pandemic response. Specifically, FL offers the potential to revolutionize pandemic preparedness within Healthcare 5.0 in several vital ways: it enables collaborative learning from distributed data sources without compromising individual data privacy, facilitates decentralized decision-making by empowering local healthcare institutions to contribute to a collective knowledge pool, and enhances real-time surveillance, enabling early detection of outbreaks and informed responses. We start by laying out the concepts of FL and Healthcare 5.0, followed by an analysis of current pandemic preparedness and response mechanisms. We delve into FL's applications and case studies in healthcare, highlighting its potential benefits, including privacy protection, decentralized decision-making, and implementation challenges. By articulating how FL fits into Healthcare 5.0, we envisage future applications in a technologically integrated health system. By examining current applications and case studies of FL in healthcare, we highlight its potential benefits, including enhanced privacy protection and more effective decision support systems. Our findings demonstrate that FL can significantly improve pandemic response times and accuracy. Moreover, we speculate on the potential scenarios where FL could enhance pandemic preparedness and make healthcare more resilient. Finally, we recommend that policymakers, technologists, and educators address potential challenges and maximize the benefits of FL in Healthcare 5.0. This paper aims to contribute to the discourse on next-generation healthcare technologies, emphasizing FL's potential to shape a more resilient healthcare future.;"[Alsamhi, Saeed Hamood] IBB Univ, Fac Engn, Ibb 70270, Yemen; [Hawbani, Ammar] Univ Sci & Technol China, Sch Comp Sci & Technol, Hefei, Peoples R China; [Shvetsov, Alexey V.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Smart Technol, Moscow, Russia; [Shvetsov, Alexey V.] North Eastern Fed Univ, Yakutsk, Russia; [Kumar, Santosh] IIIT Naya Raipur, Dept CSE, Uparwara, Chhattisgarh, India";"Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Science & Technology of China, CAS; Moscow Polytechnic University; North-Eastern Federal University in Yakutsk";Alsamhi, SH (corresponding author), IBB Univ, Fac Engn, Ibb 70270, Yemen.;"s.alsamhi.rs.ece@iitbhu.ac.in; anmande@ustc.edu.cn; a.shvetsov@vvsu.ru; santosh.rs.cse12@iitbhu.ac.in";"Alsamhi, Saeed Hamood/ABE-6903-2022; Shvetsov, Alexey Vladislavovich/R-2057-2019; Hawbani, Ammar/S-3356-2019";"Alsamhi, Saeed Hamood/0000-0003-2857-6979; Shvetsov, Alexey Vladislavovich/0000-0002-4455-0296; Hawbani, Ammar/0000-0002-1069-3993";;;;;98;2;2;1;1;HINDAWI LTD;LONDON;ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND;1687-5893;1687-5907;;ADV HUM-COMPUT INTER;Adv.

The article systematizes various models of regional tourism clusters depending on the distribution of roles, areas of interaction, the impact of integration, and the stages of the cluster life cycle: a non-core cluster, an axial cluster, a satellite cluster, and a regulated cluster. Authors concluded that due to the crisis caused by the pandemic, sanctions, and trade wars, the role of regulated tourist clusters in Russia will only increase since these clusters are more stable due to state support. In relation to external restrictions on outbound tourism, the state will focus on the development of domestic tourism while regulating the activities of tourism clusters. In this case, new projects of large-sized tourism businesses will be aimed not to obtain economic benefits but rather to demonstrate their loyalty to the existing government.

The influence of the synthesis temperature, the exposure time, and the density of the charge (TiO2 + ZrO2 + Nb2O5 + CaH2) on the mechanism and kinetics of the calcium hydride synthesis of the Ti-18Zr-15Nb beta-alloy was studied. Temperature and exposure time were established as crucial parameters with the help of regression analysis. Moreover, the correlation between the homogeneity of the powder obtained and the lattice microstrain of beta-Ti is shown. As a result, temperatures above 1200 degrees C and an exposure time longer than 12 h are required to obtain a Ti-18Zr-15Nb powder with a single beta-phase structure and uniformly distributed elements. The analysis of beta-phase growth kinetics revealed that the formation of beta-Ti occurs due to the solid-state diffusion interaction between Ti, Nb, and Zr under the calcium hydride reduction of TiO2 + ZrO2 + Nb2O5, and the spongy morphology of reduced alpha-Ti is inherited by the beta-phase. Thus, the results obtained provide a promising approach for manufacturing biocompatible porous implants from beta-Ti alloys that are believed to be attractive candidates for biomedical applications. Moreover, the current study develops and deepens the theory and practical aspects of the metallothermic synthesis of metallic materials and can be compelling to specialists in powder metallurgy.;"[Yudin, Sergey; Alimov, Ivan; Volodko, Sergey; Gurianov, Alexander; Kasimtsev, Anatoly; Sviridova, Tatiana] LLC Metsintez, Tula 300041, Russia; [Yudin, Sergey; Alimov, Ivan; Gurianov, Alexander; Markova, Galina; Kasimtsev, Anatoly; Permyakova, Darya] Tula State Univ, Mech Engn & Mat Sci Dept, Tula 300012, Russia; [Yudin, Sergey] Moscow Polytech Univ, Ctr Project Act, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Volodko, Sergey; Moskovskikh, Dmitry] Natl Univ Sci & Technol MISIS, Ctr Funct Nanoceram, Moscow 119049, Russia; [Sviridova, Tatiana] Natl Univ Sci & Technol MISIS, Inst New Mat & Nanotechnol, Moscow 119049, Russia; [Evstratov, Evgeny] Russian Acad Sci, AA Baikov Inst Met & Mat Sci, Dept Surface Phys & Chem & Ultrafine Powder Mat, Moscow 119334, Russia; [Cheverikin, Vladimir] Natl Univ Sci & Technol MISIS, Dept Phys Met Nonferrous Met, Moscow 119049, Russia";"Tula State University; Moscow Polytechnic University; National University of Science & Technology (MISIS); National University of Science & Technology (MISIS); Russian Academy of Sciences; Baikov Institute of Metallurgy & Materials Science (IMET RAS); National University of Science & Technology (MISIS)";"Yudin, S (corresponding author), LLC Metsintez, Tula 300041, Russia.;Yudin, S (corresponding author), Tula State Univ, Mech Engn & Mat Sci Dept, Tula 300012, Russia.;Yudin, S (corresponding author), Moscow Polytech Univ, Ctr Project Act, Moscow 107023, Russia.;Moskovskikh, D (corresponding author), Natl Univ Sci & Technol MISIS, Ctr Funct Nanoceram, Moscow 119049, Russia.";"sergey-usn@mail.ru; alimov.iwann@mail.ru; volodko.sv@yandex.ru; alex19021861@gmail.com; galv.mark@rambler.ru; metsintez@yandex.ru; darya.per@gmail.com; evev@imet.ac.ru; cheverikin80@rambler.ru; mos@misis.ru";"Guryanov, Alexander/IWD-7254-2023; Volodko, Sergey/ABB-1403-2022; Alimov, Ivan/IVV-7068-2023";"Guryanov, Alexander/0009-0002-4833-3245; Volodko, Sergey/0000-0001-6309-8218; Alimov, Ivan/0009-0001-4318-5071; Moskovskikh, Dmitry/0000-0001-5168-4885; Evstratov, Eugene/0009-0004-5507-7467; Yudin, Sergey/0000-0002-0531-002X";Tula region of Science and Innovation within the Russian Science Foundation [22-23-20124];Tula region of Science and Innovation within the Russian Science Foundation;The current study was conducted with the financial support of regional Committee of the Tula region of Science and Innovation within the Russian Science Foundation Project No. 22-23-20124.;;41;1;1;0;2;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;2079-4983;;J FUNCT BIOMATER;J.

Since the Internet serves as the key hub for connection and data sharing, its open nature presents security and privacy concerns and should be considered when integrating this technology into the current global healthcare system. Cybercriminals target the TMIS because it holds a lot of sensitive patient data, including medical records, personal information, and financial information. As a result, when developing a trustworthy TMIS, strict security procedures are required to deal with these concerns. Several researchers have proposed smart card-based mutual authentication methods to prevent such security attacks, indicating that this will be the preferred method for TMIS security with the IoT. In the existing literature, such methods are typically developed using computationally expensive procedures, such as bilinear pairing, elliptic curve operations, etc., which are unsuitable for biomedical devices with limited resources. Using the concept of hyperelliptic curve cryptography (HECC), we propose a new solution: a smart card-based two-factor mutual authentication scheme. In this new scheme, HECC's finest properties, such as compact parameters and key sizes, are utilized to enhance the real-time performance of an IoT-based TMIS system. The results of a security analysis indicate that the newly contributed scheme is resistant to a wide variety of cryptographic attacks. A comparison of computation and communication costs demonstrates that the proposed scheme is more cost-effective than existing schemes.;"[Khan, Muhammad Asghar; Ullah, Insaf] Hamdard Univ, Hamdard Inst Engn & Technol, Dept Elect Engn, Islamabad 44000, Pakistan; [Alhakami, Hosam] Umm Al Qura Univ, Coll Comp & Informat Syst, Dept Comp Sci, Mecca 21955, Saudi Arabia; [Alhakami, Wajdi] Taif Univ, Coll Comp & Informat Technol, Dept Informat Technol, Taif 21431, Saudi Arabia; [Shvetsov, Alexey V.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Smart Technol, St Bolshaya Semenovskaya 38, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Shvetsov, Alexey V.] North Eastern Fed Univ, Fac Transport, St Belinsky 58, Yakutsk 677000, Russia";"Hamdard University; Umm Al Qura University; Taif University; Moscow Polytechnic University; North-Eastern Federal University in Yakutsk";Khan, MA (corresponding author), Hamdard Univ, Hamdard Inst Engn & Technol, Dept Elect Engn, Islamabad 44000, Pakistan.;"m.asghar@hamdard.edu.pk; hhhakam@uqu.edu.sa; whakami@tu.edu.sa; a.shvetsov@vvsu.ru; insaf.ullah@hamdard.edu.pk";"Khan, Muhammad Asghar/AAT-3860-2020; Shvetsov, Alexey Vladislavovich/R-2057-2019";"Khan, Muhammad Asghar/0000-0002-1351-898X; Shvetsov, Alexey Vladislavovich/0000-0002-4455-0296; Alhakami, Hosam/0000-0002-4908-5573; Alhakami, Wajdi/0000-0003-1230-9470";;;;;28;0;0;1;4;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;1424-8220;;SENSORS-BASEL;Sensors;JUN;2023;23;12;;;;;;;5419;10.3390/s23125419;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s23125419;;;15;"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation";K3XI0;37420585;gold, Green Published;;;2024-04-12;WOS:001015797100001;View Full Record in Web of Science

The study was conducted in 2022 using qualitative data collection methods. The study shows that the formation of technogenic civilization is due to the influence of scientific and technological thinking, whose emergence is caused by the requirements of modern reality, where the cultural and humanitarian spheres give way to scientific and technological. Scientific and technological thinking conditions the development of information and computer technologies that generate informational thinking. It is concluded that science is the base and means of systematizing natural and social reality. It causes the emergence and development of engineering and technology. On their basis, scientific and technological thinking is formed, whose philosophical and methodological foundation is rationalism. The transformation of scientific and technological thinking in the process of social changes leads to the emergence of informational thinking, which is the result of the development of information and digital technologies and appears as a mode of scientific and technological thinking.;"[Kotlyarova, Victoria] Inst Serv & Entrepreneurship branch DSTU Shakhty, Shakhty, Russia; [Isakova, Gulizar] Dagestan State Univ, Makhachkala, Russia; [Vaslavskaya, Irina] Kazan Volga Fed Univ, Naberezhnye Chelny Inst, Kazan, Russia; [Gorlova, Olga] Moscow Polytech Univ, Moscow, Russia; [Putrik, Iurii] Russian Heritage Inst, Moscow, Russia; [Molochnikov, Nikolaj] Kuban State Univ, Krasnodar, Russia";"Dagestan State University; Kazan Federal University; Moscow Polytechnic University; Kuban State University";Kotlyarova, V (corresponding author), Inst Serv & Entrepreneurship branch DSTU Shakhty, Shakhty, Russia.;"biktoria66@mail.ru; gulizarisakova@mail.ru; vaslavskaya@yandex.ru; business007@bk.ru; putrik@list.ru; mnr001@mail.ru";"Kotlyarova, Victoria Валентиновна/O-7686-2014; VASLAVSKAYA, IRINA YU/V-6995-2017; Горлова, Ольга/AAA-9900-2021";"Kotlyarova, Victoria Валентиновна/0000-0001-6419-6119; VASLAVSKAYA, IRINA YU/0000-0002-1363-3865; Горлова, Ольга/0000-0001-7108-2769";;;;;38;0;0;0;4;UNIV CATOLICA PETROPOLIS;PETROPOLIS;UNIV CATOLICA PETROPOLIS, PETROPOLIS, 00000, BRAZIL;1678-6785;1984-6754;;SYNESIS;Synesis;OCT-DEC;2023;15;4;;;;;;;e2741;;;;;13;Philosophy;Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI);Philosophy;O6LT6;;;;;2024-04-12;WOS:001044907500010;View Full Record in Web of Science

The following approaches were used in the study: computational, classification, and car-tographic methods, aerospace, geoinformation technologies. The research uses a five-level framework for defining final ecosystem services. Such framework can be applied on specific territories if transformed according to the following scheme: type of a class-class-group-division-section. This scheme allows one to specify the indicators of an ecosystem service and clarify its functions at each hierarchical level. To improve objectivity of area's ecological integrity evaluation, as well as accuracy and complete-ness of input materials for further evaluation of ecosystem services, it is proposed to determine the degree of ecological stability, the level of envi-ronmental risk and the degree of anthropogenic impact as basic indicators of the studied region. The approach is applied for the territory of an aver-age village council. The implementation of a donor-recipient system of interregional relations is proposed for two ecosystem services: prevention of water erosion and recreation. Using cartographic materials and historical archival aerospace images for desktop and field research on the assessment of ecosystem services reduces the time used for this work. Developing and implementing land consolidation projects somewhat neutralize the negative effects of fragmentation and the existing inconsistency of administrative boundaries and ecosystems.

The studies were carried out during the turning of steel with subsequent investigation of the wear area using scanning (SEM) and transmission (TEM) microscopes. Although the main parameters (elemental composition and structure) are identical and the values of hardness and elastic modulus are close, tools with the coatings under consideration demonstrated noticeable difference in wear resistance. The (Mo,Y,Al)N coated tool had a wear resistance 45% higher than the (Cr,Y,Al)N coated tool and 30% higher than the (Ti,Cr,Al)N reference coated tool. Active formation of cracks is detected in the (Cr,Y,Al) N coating, while oxidation wear dominated in the (Mo,Y,Al)N coating. Therefore, coatings containing layers of materials characterized by an increased tendency to oxidize, but at the same time providing a favorable compositional effect, can be effectively used. This is possible provided that the oxidation-resistant layers protect the oxidation-prone layers from active contact with oxygen.;"[Grigoriev, Sergey; Seleznev, Anton; Sotova, Catherine] Moscow State Technol Univ STANKIN, Vadkovsky Per 1, Moscow 127994, Russia; [Vereschaka, Alexey; Bublikov, Jury] IDTI RAS, Vadkovsky Per 18-1a, Moscow 127994, Russia; [Milovich, Filipp] Natl Univ Sci & Technol MISiS, Leninsky Prospect 4, Moscow 119049, Russia; [Milovich, Filipp] Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Mat Sci, Bolshaya Semyonovskaya St 38, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Sitnikov, Nikolay] Keldysh Res Ctr, Onezhskaya St,8,Bldg 41, Moscow 125438, Russia";"Moscow State Technology University Stankin; National University of Science & Technology (MISIS); Moscow Polytechnic University; Roscosmos; Keldysh Research Center";Vereschaka, A (corresponding author), IDTI RAS, Vadkovsky Per 18-1a, Moscow 127994, Russia.;"s.grigoriev@stankin.ru; dr.a.veres@yandex.ru; filippmilovich@mail.ru; sitnikov_nikolay@mail.ru; yubu@rambler.ru; a.seleznev@stankin.ru; e.sotova@stankin.ru";"Sotova, Ekaterina/A-4143-2014; Seleznev, Anton A.E./M-5042-2016; Vereschaka, Alexey/A-9052-2014";"Sotova, Ekaterina/0000-0002-6720-0635; Vereschaka, Alexey/0000-0001-9776-0548";Russian Science Foundation [21-79-30058];Russian Science Foundation(Russian Science Foundation (RSF));Funding The study was supported by a grant from the Russian Science Foundation (project No. 21-79-30058) .;;78;3;3;2;4;ELSEVIER SCIENCE SA;LAUSANNE;PO BOX 564, 1001 LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND;0043-1648;1873-2577;;WEAR;Wear;SEP 15;2023;528;;;;;;;;204989;10.1016/j.wear.2023.204989;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wear.2023.204989;;MAY 2023;12;"Engineering, Mechanical; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Engineering; Materials Science";J6MI5;;;;;2024-04-12;WOS:001010735100001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Concentration of attention is a critical cognitive function that impacts learning. This study involved 129 healthy schoolchildren aged 8-10 years (spanning grades 2 and 3) from a regular secondary school in Kirov, Russian Federation. A physical education minute (PEM), consisting of various physical exercises, was introduced during the middle of a regular lesson for the experimental group (EG), while the control group (CG) continued with their regular studies. Concentration and attention were assessed before and after the PEM using the Bourdon test. The Bourdon test results indicated a significant decrease in concentration during the lesson for the CG (p < 0.001), while the EG exhibited significant improvement in concentration after the PEM (p < 0.001). The effect size was large, demonstrating a substantial impact of this break for physical activity on concentration. It can be concluded that implementing a set of exercises in the form of a PEM in the middle of a lesson significantly improves concentration among students aged 8-10.

However, they have not been legitimized at the state level in all countries. This study aims at analyzing the international experience of regulating cryptocurrencies to introduce them into financial systems. Using the methods of document analysis and expert survey, the authors of the article explain the nature of cryptocurrency, the reasons for its emergence, and the possibility of its regulation. Based on international experience, the authors determine the main models for regulating cryptocurrencies by national legislation. The authors prove that a significant number of people prefer using cryptocurrencies as a means of payment and digital financial assets over traditional (fiat) money. The use of cryptocurrencies poses a problem in implementing the state financial policy. This is conditioned by conflicting goals and objectives of the state policy, which does not allow recognizing cryptocurrencies as monetary units of account and means of interstate payments. The article dwells on the possibility of resolving these contradictions since this will have to be done in the future. The main trend in the regulation of cryptocurrencies is an approach where their prohibition is an ineffective and even socially dangerous mechanism. In this regard, it is necessary to develop state stablecoins as an alternative to private cryptocurrencies.;"[Vasyukov, Vitalii] Moscow State Inst Int Relat, Moscow, Russia; [Kochetkov, Evgeniy] Financial Univ Govt Russian Federat, Moscow, Russia; [Ostrovskaya, Anastasiya] Kuban State Univ, Krasnodar, Russia; [Generalova, Anna] Kosygin State Univ Russia, Moscow, Russia; [Filonova, Anna] Moscow Polytech Univ, Moscow, Russia";"MGIMO University; Financial University Under the Government of Russian Federation; Kuban State University; Kosygin State University of Russia; Moscow Polytechnic University";Vasyukov, V (corresponding author), Moscow State Inst Int Relat, Moscow, Russia.;"v.f.vasyukov@mail.ru; kochetkov.e.p@mail.ru; kaff224@yandex.ru; generalann@yandex.ru; annasf76@mail.ru";"Vasyukov, Vitaly/ABF-6284-2020; Generalova, Anna Vladimirovna/E-3700-2014; Filonova, Anna Sergeevna/AAW-2806-2020";"Vasyukov, Vitaly/0000-0003-0743-5616; Filonova, Anna Sergeevna/0000-0003-2664-1407";;;;;34;0;0;0;4;UNIV CATOLICA PETROPOLIS;PETROPOLIS;UNIV CATOLICA PETROPOLIS, PETROPOLIS, 00000, BRAZIL;2175-0947;;;LEX HUMANA;Lex Humana;JUL-SEP;2023;15;3;;;;;;;e2597;;;;;13;Law;Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI);Government & Law;K4JU2;;;;;2024-04-12;WOS:001016125200011;View Full Record in Web of Science

Crystals were grown by directed crystallization of the melt in a cold crucible. Crystals were studied by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, impedance spectroscopy, and indentation. The concentration dependences of the investigated characteristics of crystals are obtained. It has been shown that an increase in the concentration of the stabilizing oxide in all cases leads to a decrease in the amount of the transformed t-phase and reduces the value of the crack resistance of the crystals. In this case, a decrease in the size of the twins and an increase in the defectiveness of the structure are observed, which is accompanied by a slight decrease in the electrical conductivity of tetragonal solid solutions. The influence of the ionic radius of trivalent cations on the stabilization of tetragonal phases, conductivity, and the mechanical properties of crystals is discussed. An increase in the values of crack resistance and a decrease in the values of high-temperature electrical conductivity of tetragonal solid solutions in the series Y2O3 -> Gd2O3 -> Sm2O3 at comparable concentrations of stabilizing oxides were established.

Pooling medical data into a centralized storage system to train a robust ML model, on the other hand, poses privacy, ownership, and regulatory challenges. Federated learning (FL) overcomes the prior problems with a centralized aggregator server and a shared global model. However, there are two technical challenges: 1) FL members need to be motivated to contribute their time and effort and 2) the centralized FL server may not accurately aggregate the global model. Therefore, combining the blockchain and FL can overcome these issues and provide high-level security and privacy for smart healthcare in a decentralized fashion. This study integrates two emerging technologies, blockchain and FL, for healthcare. We describe how blockchain-based FL plays a fundamental role in improving competent healthcare, where edge nodes manage the blockchain to avoid a single point of failure, while IoMT devices employ FL to use dispersed clinical data fully. We discuss the benefits and limitations of combining both technologies based on a content analysis approach. We emphasize three main research streams based on a systematic analysis of blockchain-empowered: 1) IoMT; 2) electronic health records (EHRs) and electronic medical records (EMRs) management; and 3) digital healthcare systems (internal consortium/secure alerting).

From the perspective of Islam, it has been also affirmed that two people have the same thoughts and opinions in one centre point of love in brotherhood, so fraternal feelings are not merely limited to kinship and consanguinity. In this line, the Holy Qur'an states that we have come to make you brothers with each other; not a brotherhood from parents, but an Islamic one, which is highly appreciated in the Islamic society. In addition, a believing brother can never be filled when his fellow believer is hungry, and he cannot be clothed while the other is with nothing on. Islam further considers all Muslims as one family and calls everyone brothers and sisters or siblings. The true Muslims of any race and tribe as well as any language and age thus have a deep sense of brotherhood with each other, even if one lives in the Eastern parts of the world and the other in the West. In sum, this article aimed to investigate the role of religious teachings in strengthening believers' brotherhood in the Islamic society. For this purpose, firstly, the definition of religious brotherhood was provided; secondly, religious brotherhood has been described based on the Holy Qur'an.Contribution: This article helped gain a new insight into the role of Islamic teachings in strengthening religious brotherhood in the Islamic society.

Fast and efficient combustion synthesis (CS), spark plasma sintering (SPS), and reactive SPS (RSPS) methods were used to synthesize the HE powders and bulks. The formation of the main B2 phase along with some amounts of secondary BCC and FCC phases are reported, and L12 intermetallic (CS scheme) and BCC based on Cr (CS + SPS and RSPS schemes at 1000 degrees C) were observed in all samples. The interaction between the components during heating to 1600 degrees C of the mechanically activated mixtures and CS powders has been studied. It has been shown that the formation of the CoNi0.3Fe0.3Cr0.15Al phase occurs at 1370 degrees C through the formation of intermediate intermetallic phases (Al9Me2, AlCo, AlNi3) and their solid solutions, which coincidences well with thermodynamic calculations and solubility diagrams. Compression tests at room and elevated temperatures showed that the alloy obtained by the RSPS method has enhanced mechanical properties (sigma(p) = 2.79 GPa, sigma(0.2) = 1.82 GPa, epsilon = 11.5% at 400 degrees C) that surpass many known alloys in this system. High mechanical properties at elevated temperatures are provided by the B2 ordered phase due to the presence of impurity atoms and defects in the lattice.;"[Kuskov, Kirill Vasilevich; Nepapushev, Andrey A.

This paradigm shift in early detection and intervention has the potential to profoundly alter our strategies for cancer prevention and treatment. One pivotal area where genetic testing can have a significant impact is among families with a hereditary predisposition to cancer. Recent research has seen a surge in the exploration of how individuals perceive their cancer risk within the realm of cancer genetics. This proactive approach to genetic testing allows healthcare professionals to identify family members who may carry the same cancer-related genetic mutations, empowering them to make informed decisions regarding their healthcare and cancer risk management. Genetic testing for cancer-related disorders has significantly improved in accuracy and affordability, potentially revolutionizing monitoring and treatment methods. The expanding knowledge of genetic mutations associated with cancer susceptibility has driven significant progress in cancer therapy. Identifying numerous major cancer susceptibility genes has propelled predictive genetic testing, providing individuals with valuable insights into their genetic predisposition to cancer. While perceived risk plays a vital role in genetic counseling, it is equally essential to offer comprehensive information about the advantages and potential risks associated with genetic testing. Ensuring that individuals have a clear understanding of the benefits and potential drawbacks of genetic testing is imperative for making informed healthcare decisions. In our comprehensive review, researchers explored several critical aspects of genetic testing in the context of cancer, including awareness and knowledge, the communication of cancer genetic risk, genetic testing for inherited cancer syndromes, and the challenges and limitations linked to genetic testing.

The authors analyze the major problems facing today's school education, such as the technological di-vide between the generations of students and teachers, the in-dividualization of education, the divide between the visual and textual cultures in education, digital inequality, gamification, and information noise. The context for the analysis is the need to develop new strategies for the education of modern school students, whose worldview is formed amid the accelerated de-velopment of digital technology. The authors conclude that the leading form of socialization for today's generation of school students is digital socialization, which forms network identities. This generation independently forms and controls their informal educational strategies aimed at the formation and development of a digital human.

However, this rapid advancement is also polluting our air ambience. Hence real-time detection and estimation of hazardous gases/odors in the air ambiance has become a critical need. In this paper, a convolutional neural network (CNN) based multi-element gas sensor arrays signature response analysis approach has been presented to achieve higher accuracy in detection and estimation of hazardous gases. Accordingly, the real-time gas sensor array responses are spatially upscaled and processed on the edge, using lightweight CNNs. For the verification of our hypothesis, we have used a four-element metal oxide semi-conductor (MOS)-based thick-film gas sensor array, fabricated by our group, by using SnO2, ZnO, MoO, CdS materials for detection and estimation of four target hazardous gases, viz., acetone, carbon-tetrachloride, ethyl-methyl-ketone, and xylene. The four-element (2 x 2) raw sensor responses are first upscaled to 6 x 6 responses and a lightweight CNN is trained on 42 samples of 6 x 6 input vectors. The trained system is then tested using 16 unknown (not used during training) test samples of the considered gases/odors. All the 16 test samples are detected correctly. The Mean Squared Error (MSEs) of detection has been 1.42 x 10(-14 )while the estimation accuracy of 2.43 x 10(-3) were achieved for the considered gases.

The activating agent was applied by two methods: impregnation and subsequent autoclave treatment. When the powder was activated by the impregnation method, the crystal sizes remained at the initial level of 0.17-0.19 mu m. After the autoclave treatment, the crystal sizes increased to 0.31-0.53 mu m. Samples of cold sintering ZnO with relative density up to 0.96 and average grain sizes 0.29-0.86 mu m were obtained. ZnO powders and ceramic samples were analyzed using SEM, TGA/DSC, and XRD to reveal the effect of the powder activation method and cold sintering conditions on the material microstructure. The effect of ammonium chloride concentration on grain growth and microstructure of ceramic samples is shown. It was found that the average grain size of ceramic samples with an increase in additive concentration passes through a minimum. In cold sintering of the autoclave activated powder, the effect of reducing the average grain size was observed.

The wastes of non-ferrous metallurgy sub-branches form exploitable resources, which, in addition to economic damage from incomplete metal extraction, cause environmental problems. The primary technologies for processing complex ores, which fail to provide waste-free concentration, cause an imbalance between raw material extraction and processing indicators since all the applied methods do not provide waste-free concentration processes. It is possible to increase the extraction of metals up to the background level by treating them with chemical reagent solutions at the time of formation of active mineral surfaces. There is also a tendency to involve metal leaching technologies in the exploitation of waste storages. The possibility of improving recovery rates during ore concentration provides a combination of traditional technologies with new technologies by supplementing the traditional technological chain with activator devices. The combination of traditional and new low-waste technologies will strengthen mineral safety through the rational use of the existing mineral resource base.;"[Golik, V. I.; Klyuev, R.

Crystals with the composition of (ZrO2)(0.99-x)(Sc2O3)(x)(R2O3)(0.01) (where x = 0.08-0.1; R-Yb, Y, Tb, Gd) were obtained by the method of directed melt crystallization in a cold crucible. The crystals were annealed in air at a temperature of 1000 degrees C for 400 h. The phase analysis of the crystals before and after annealing was studied by X-ray diffractometry and Raman spectroscopy. The study of the ionic conductivity of the crystals was carried out by the method of impedance spectroscopy in the temperature range 400-900 degrees C. It has been shown that when various rare earth cations (Yb, Y, Tb, and Gd) are used, the maximum conductivity is observed for the compositions (ZrO2)(0.91)(Sc2O3)(0.08)(Yb2O3)(0.01), (ZrO2)(0.89)(Sc2O3)(0.1)(Y2O3)(0.01), (ZrO2)(0.90)(Sc2O3)(0.09)(Tb2O3)(0.01), and (ZrO2)(0.89)(Sc2O3)(0.1)(Gd2O3)(0.01). At the same time, these crystals have a highly symmetrical pseudocubic structure, which is retained even after crystal annealing. At comparable concentrations of Sc2O3, the conductivity of crystals decreases with an increase in the ionic radius of the rare earth cation.

E-noses generate unique signature patterns for various volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and, by leveraging artificial intelligence, detect the presence of various VOCs, gases, and smokes onsite. Widespread monitoring of airborne hazards across many remote locations is possible by creating a network of gas sensors using Internet connectivity, which consumes significant power. Long-range (LoRa)-based wireless networks do not require Internet connectivity while operating independently. Therefore, we propose a networked intelligent gas sensor system (N-IGSS) which uses a LoRa low-power wide-area networking protocol for real-time airborne pollution hazard detection and monitoring. We developed a gas sensor node by using an array of seven cross-selective tin-oxide-based metal-oxide semiconductor (MOX) gas sensor elements interfaced with a low-power microcontroller and a LoRa module. Experimentally, we exposed the sensor node to six classes i.e., five VOCs plus ambient air and as released by burning samples of tobacco, paints, carpets, alcohol, and incense sticks. Using the proposed two-stage analysis space transformation approach, the captured dataset was first preprocessed using the standardized linear discriminant analysis (SLDA) method. Four different classifiers, namely AdaBoost, XGBoost, Random Forest (RF), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), were then trained and tested in the SLDA transformation space. The proposed N-IGSS achieved all correct identification of 30 unknown test samples with a low mean squared error (MSE) of 1.42 x 10(-4) over a distance of 590 m.;"[Kumar, Kanak; Chaudhri, Shiv Nath; Rajput, Navin Singh] Indian Inst Technol BHU, Dept Elect Engn, Varanasi 221005, India; [Chaudhri, Shiv Nath] Santhiram Engn Coll, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Nandyal 518501, India; [Shvetsov, Alexey V.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Smart Technol, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Shvetsov, Alexey V.] North Eastern Fed Univ, Dept Transport, Yakutsk 677000, Russia; [Sahal, Radhya] Univ Coll Cork, Sch Comp Sci & IT, Cork T12K8AF, Ireland; [Sahal, Radhya] Hodeidah Univ, Fac Comp Sci & Engn, POB 3114, Al Hodeidah, Yemen; [Alsamhi, Saeed Hamood] Ibb Univ, Fac Engn, POB 70270, Ibb, Yemen";"Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology BHU Varanasi (IIT BHU Varanasi); Moscow Polytechnic University; North-Eastern Federal University in Yakutsk; University College Cork; Hodeidah University";Rajput, NS (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol BHU, Dept Elect Engn, Varanasi 221005, India.;"kanakkumar.rs.ece18@iitbhu.ac.in; shivnathchaudhri.rs.ece17@iitbhu.ac.in; nsrajput.ece@iitbhu.ac.in; a.shvetsov@vvsu.ru; rsahal@ucc.ie; s.alsamhi.rs.ece@iitbhu.ac.in";"Chaudhri, Shiv Nath/JUU-3600-2023; Alsamhi, Saeed Hamood/ABE-6903-2022; Shvetsov, Alexey Vladislavovich/R-2057-2019";"Chaudhri, Shiv Nath/0000-0002-5436-2977; Alsamhi, Saeed Hamood/0000-0003-2857-6979; Shvetsov, Alexey Vladislavovich/0000-0002-4455-0296; Sahal, Radhya/0000-0002-8019-9069";;;;;28;6;6;5;7;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;1424-8220;;SENSORS-BASEL;Sensors;MAY 19;2023;23;10;;;;;;;4885;10.3390/s23104885;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s23104885;;;18;"Chemistry, Analytical; Engineering, Electrical & Electronic; Instruments & Instrumentation";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Chemistry; Engineering; Instruments & Instrumentation";H6LK3;37430799;Green Published, gold;;;2024-04-12;WOS:000997053600001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Homologues with methoxy and alkyloxy substituents (series 1) are non-mesogenic, in contrast to homologues with two alkyloxy substituents (series 2) exhibiting columnar mesophase. The results obtained by quantum-chemical calculations for the monomers and dimers of non-mesogenic TTT series and their comparison with truxenone derivatives having identical substituents made it possible to establish the reasons that deprive series 1 of mesogenity. Compounds of both TTT series possess good solubility in organic solvents and capable of specific interactions with solvents in the ground and excited states.

The dangers and threats are becoming more interdependent. Society needs to not only introduce advanced technologies and respond to the challenges of environmental hazards in time but also create legal fail -safes to ensure environmental security. The present study aims to analyze constitutional and legal norms for the provision of environmental security and directions for their improvement. Based on an analysis of legislation and legal literature, the paper defines constitutional and legal provisions of environmental security and analyzes the provisions of the Russian Constitution that act as a legal base for the development, adoption, and implementation of the legal norms to ensure the country's environmental security. Proceeding from an expert survey, proposals are formulated for improving constitutional norms by making them environmentally friendly to better ensure environmental security. The authors conclude on the need to ensure further improvement of constitutional provisions in the sphere of environmental security in accordance with the theory and practice of modern constitutionalism and guaranteeing its stability and inviolability.;"[Alekseev, Evgeny] Natl Res Univ, Moscow State Univ Civil Engn MGSU, Moscow, Russia; [Ivashkin, Mikhail] Pacific Natl Univ, Khabarovsk, Russia; [Shelygov, Aleksandr] Moscow Polytech Univ, Moscow, Russia; [Aleshkov, Alexey] Khabarovsk State Univ Econ & Law KSUEL, Khabarovsk, Russia; [Vukovich, Galina] Kuban State Univ, Krasnodar, Russia; [Shestemirov, Alexey] Financial Univ Govt Russian Federat, Moscow, Russia; Peoples Friendship Univ Russia, Moscow, Russia";"Moscow State University of Civil Engineering; Pacific National University; Moscow Polytechnic University; Kuban State University; Financial University Under the Government of Russian Federation; Peoples Friendship University of Russia";Alekseev, E (corresponding author), Natl Res Univ, Moscow State Univ Civil Engn MGSU, Moscow, Russia.;"alekseeve@mgsu.ru; ivashkin@mail.ru; shelygov@mail.ru; alexey.aleshkov@bk.ru; kaf224@yandex.ru; aashe@yandex.ru";"Vukovich, Galina Grigor'evna/IQV-1182-2023; Shestemirov, Alexey/AET-7646-2022; Shelygov, Aleksandr/N-7139-2015; Alekseev, Evgeny Valerevich/AAG-4008-2019";"Vukovich, Galina Grigor'evna/0000-0001-8993-8289; Shestemirov, Alexey/0000-0002-2355-6277; Shelygov, Aleksandr/0000-0003-1082-628X; Alekseev, Evgeny Valerevich/0000-0001-6345-3240";;;;;32;1;1;0;2;UNIV CATOLICA PETROPOLIS;PETROPOLIS;UNIV CATOLICA PETROPOLIS, PETROPOLIS, 00000, BRAZIL;2175-0947;;;LEX HUMANA;Lex Humana;AUG-DEC;2023;15;2;;;;;;;;;;;;14;Law;Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI);Government & Law;C2RR1;;;;;2024-04-12;WOS:000960455800028;View Full Record in Web of Science

At present, this trai-ning cannot be provided without modern approaches to educa-tion, which make lessons productive and interesting not only for students who freely use modern electronic devices but also for teachers as they provide optimization of the learning process. One of the current methods of foreign language teaching with ac-tive use of information technology is the use of the MyEnglishLab interactive platform for learning English. The paper presents an analysis of the platform's possibilities as an innovative tool for teaching English to economics students in the blended learning format that focuses on the development of communication skills, enhances the individualization of learning, and forms sustaina-ble motivation for foreign language activities. The results of the experimental study convincingly testify to the positive changes in the distribution of motives for learning English and the attitu-de of future economists to mastering a foreign language. This confirms the efficiency of using the platform in the professional foreign language training of students and exerting a positive in-fluence on their motivational sphere.;"[Pivneva, Svetlana] Russian State Social Univ, Moscow Polytech Univ, Moscow, Russia; [Chernova, Oxana] Peoples Friendship Univ Russia, Moscow, Russia; [Abalyan, Zhanna] Financial Univ Govt Russian Federat, Moscow, Russia; [Shangaraeva, Liya] Kazan Fed Univ, Kazan, Russia; [Rubannikova, Irina] Russian Univ Transport MIIT, Moscow, Russia; [Litvinov, Aleksandr] Moscow State Univ Psychol & Educ MSUPE, Moscow, Russia";"Russian State Social University (RSSU); Moscow Polytechnic University; Peoples Friendship University of Russia; Financial University Under the Government of Russian Federation; Kazan Federal University; Russian University of Transport; Moscow State University of Psychology & Education";Pivneva, S (corresponding author), Russian State Social Univ, Moscow Polytech Univ, Moscow, Russia.;"tlt-swetlana@yandex.ru; oxana-c@mail.ru; ZAAbalyan@fa.ru; sh-liya@yandex.ru; irina-rubannikova@mail.ru; alisal01@yandex.ru";"Shangaraeva, Liya/E-1393-2015; Chernova, Oxana E/T-7120-2017; Abalyan, Zhanna/ITT-4064-2023";"Shangaraeva, Liya/0000-0002-1777-5852; Chernova, Oxana E/0000-0002-0609-0620; Abalyan, Zhanna/0000-0003-2255-9019";;;;;20;4;4;2;4;UNIV CIENFUEGOS;CIENFUEGOS;CARRETERA RODAS KM 4, CUATRO CAMINOS, CIENFUEGOS, 00000, CUBA;1990-8644;;;REV CONRADO;REV.

Each of these elements is simulated separately. Since all these models form a single system (ship), they are interdependent. The operating modes of some systems influence others, but at the same time, the work of all the systems should be aimed at fulfilling the basic functions of the ship. The work proposes a methodological approach to combining various systems of ships into a single complex model. This model allows combining models of ship systems of various levels (microlevel, macrolevel, metalevel, megalevel). The work provides examples of models of such multi-level energy systems. These are energy systems composed of an electric generator, a diesel engine, a propeller shaft, and algorithms used for operating the common parts of the ship's electric power system and a piston wear process. Analytical, structural, numerical, and object-oriented models were made for these objects. Each of these particular models describes a limited class of problems, has characteristic properties, and a mathematical structure. The work shows how particular models can be interconnected using a set-theoretic description. Particular models are combined into macrolevel models, whose output parameters are quantities that are by no means related. The macrolevel models are interrelated using control models. Control models belong to the metalevel and allow for assigning settings and response thresholds to algorithms used in automation systems. Such a model (megalevel model) allows, ultimately, investigating the dynamics of the entire system as a whole and managing it.;"[Boychuk, Igor P.] Admiral Ushakov Maritime State Univ, Marine Engn Fac, Dept Higher Math & Phys, Novorossiysk 353918, Russia; [Grinek, Anna V.] Admiral Ushakov Maritime State Univ, Marine Engn Fac, Dept Operat Ships Elect Equipment & Automatic Devi, Novorossiysk 353918, Russia; [Martyushev, Nikita V.] Tomsk Polytech Univ, Dept Adv Technol, 30 Lenin Ave, Tomsk 634050, Russia; [Klyuev, Roman V.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Tech & Technol Min & Oil & Gas Prod, 33 B Semenovskaya Str, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Malozyomov, Boris V.] Novosibirsk State Tech Univ, Dept Electrotech Complexes, 20 Karl Marks Ave, Novosibirsk 630073, Russia; [Tynchenko, Vadim S.; Tynchenko, Yadviga A.] Siberian Fed Univ, Sch Petr & Nat Gas Engn, Dept Technol Machines & Equipment Oil & Gas Comple, Krasnoyarsk 660041, Russia; [Tynchenko, Vadim S.; Tynchenko, Yadviga A.] Reshetnev Siberian State Univ Sci & Technol, Inst Comp Sci & Telecommun, Informat Control Syst Dept, Krasnoyarsk 660037, Russia; [Tynchenko, Vadim S.] Bauman Moscow State Tech Univ, Artificial Intelligence Technol Sci & Educ Ctr, Moscow 105005, Russia; [Kukartsev, Viktor A.] Siberian Fed Univ, Polytech Inst, Dept Mat Sci & Mat Proc Technol, Krasnoyarsk 660041, Russia; [Kondratiev, Sergey I.] Admiral Ushakov Maritime State Univ, Fac Water Transport Operat & Nav, Dept Ships Nav, Novorossiysk 353918, Russia";"Tomsk Polytechnic University; Moscow Polytechnic University; Novosibirsk State Technical University; Siberian Federal University; Reshetnev Siberian State University of Science & Technology; Bauman Moscow State Technical University; Siberian Federal University";Klyuev, RV (corresponding author), Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Tech & Technol Min & Oil & Gas Prod, 33 B Semenovskaya Str, Moscow 107023, Russia.;"boychuk@aumsu.ru; grinyokann@gmail.com; martjushev@tpu.ru; kluev-roman@rambler.ru; borisnovel@mail.ru; t080801@yandex.ru";"Klyuev, Roman/J-8000-2014; Klyuev, Roman Vladimirovich/AAX-6549-2021; Martyushev, Nikita/AAO-2653-2020";"Klyuev, Roman/0000-0003-3777-7203; Klyuev, Roman Vladimirovich/0000-0003-3777-7203; Martyushev, Nikita/0000-0003-0620-9561";;;;;48;2;2;1;1;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;1996-1073;;ENERGIES;Energies;DEC;2023;16;24;;;;;;;8101;10.3390/en16248101;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en16248101;;;28;Energy & Fuels;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Energy & Fuels;DG5I7;;gold;;;2024-04-12;WOS:001130884700001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Recent studies have demonstrated the superior quality of solutions based on various machine learning models. These models learn to classify supernova types using their light curves as inputs. Preprocessing these curves is a crucial step that significantly affects the final quality. In this talk, we study the application of multilayer perceptron (MLP), bayesian neural network (BNN), and normalizing flows (NF) to approximate observations for a single light curve. We use these approximations as inputs for supernovae classification models and demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform the state-of-the-art based on Gaussian processes applying to the Zwicky Transient Facility Bright Transient Survey light curves. MLP demonstrates similar quality as Gaussian processes and speed increase. Normalizing Flows exceeds Gaussian processes in terms of approximation quality as well.;"[Demianenko, Mariia; Derkach, Denis; Hushchyn, Mikhail] HSE Univ, 20 Myasnitskaya Ulitsa, Moscow 101000, Russia; [Malanchev, Konstantin] Lomonosov Moscow State Univ, Sternberg Astron Inst, Univ Sky Pr 13, Moscow 119234, Russia; [Demianenko, Mariia; Sysak, Mikhail] Moscow Inst Phys & Technol, Inst Skii Pereulok 9, Dolgoprudnyi 141700, Moscow Region, Russia; [Samorodova, Ekaterina] Lomonosov Moscow State Univ, Fac Space Res, Leninskiye Gory 1,Bldg 52, Moscow 119234, Russia; [Shiriaev, Aleksandr] Moscow Polytech Univ, Tverskaya St 11, Moscow 125993, Russia; [Malanchev, Konstantin] Univ Illinois, Dept Astron, 1002 West Green St, Urbana, IL 61801 USA";"HSE University (National Research University Higher School of Economics); Lomonosov Moscow State University; Moscow Institute of Physics & Technology; Lomonosov Moscow State University; Moscow Polytechnic University; University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign";Hushchyn, M (corresponding author), HSE Univ, 20 Myasnitskaya Ulitsa, Moscow 101000, Russia.;mhushchyn@hse.ru;;Demianenko, Mariia/0000-0002-8297-6386;"RFBR; CNRS [21-52-15024]; Academic Fund Program at the HSE University in 2022 [22-00-025]";"RFBR(Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR)); CNRS(Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)); Academic Fund Program at the HSE University in 2022";KM work on data preparation is supported by the RFBR and CNRS according to the research project.21-52-15024.

A fire is extinguished better when the right type of fire retardant is used. A thumb rule on firefighting also says, never fight a fire if you do not know what is burning. In this paper, we have proposed an Intelligent Decision Support System (ID2S4FH) to generate a real-time 'fire-map' of such SDCs during a fire hazard. We have interfaced six tin-oxide-based gas sensor elements, a temperature and humidity sensor, and a particulate matter (PM) sensor with microcontrollers to capture the real-time signature patterns of the ambient air. We burned sixteen different types of materials belonging to six classes of fire and created a dataset consisting of 2400 samples. The sensor array responses were then pre-processed and analysed using various classifiers trained in different analysis space domains. Among the classifiers, four classifiers achieved 'all correct' identification of the fire classes of 80 unknown test samples, and the lowest mean squared error (MSE) achieved was 2.81 x 10(-3). During a fire hazard, our proposed ID2S4FH can generate real-time fire maps of SDCs and help firefighters to extinguish the fire using the appropriate fire retardant.;"[Kumar, Kanak; Rajput, Navin Singh] Indian Inst Technol BHU, Dept Elect Engn, Varanasi 221005, India; [Shvetsov, Alexey V.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Smart Technol, St Bolshaya Semenovskaya 38, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Shvetsov, Alexey V.] North Eastern Fed Univ, Fac Transport, St Belinsky 58, Yakutsk 677000, Russia; [Saif, Abdu] Taiz Univ, Fac Engn & IT, Dept Commun & Comp Engn, POB 6803, Taizi, Yemen; [Sahal, Radhya] Univ Coll Cork, Sch Comp Sci & IT, Cork T12 K8AF, Ireland; [Sahal, Radhya] Hodeidah Univ, Fac Comp Sci & Engn, POB 3114, Al Hodeidah, Yemen; [Alsamhi, Saeed Hamood] IBB Univ, Fac Engn, POB 70270, Ibb, Yemen";"Indian Institute of Technology System (IIT System); Indian Institute of Technology BHU Varanasi (IIT BHU Varanasi); Moscow Polytechnic University; North-Eastern Federal University in Yakutsk; Taiz University; University College Cork; Hodeidah University";Rajput, NS (corresponding author), Indian Inst Technol BHU, Dept Elect Engn, Varanasi 221005, India.;"kanakkumar.rs.ece18@iitbhu.ac.in; nsrajput.ece@iitbhu.ac.in; a.shvetsov@vvsu.ru; abduh.saif2017@siswa.um.edu.my; rsahal@ucc.ie; s.alsamhi.rs.ece@iitbhu.ac.in";"Saif, Abdu Ahmed/GXM-7369-2022; Alsamhi, Saeed Hamood/ABE-6903-2022; Shvetsov, Alexey Vladislavovich/R-2057-2019";"Alsamhi, Saeed Hamood/0000-0003-2857-6979; Shvetsov, Alexey Vladislavovich/0000-0002-4455-0296; Sahal, Radhya/0000-0002-8019-9069";;;;;30;1;1;3;3;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;2571-6255;;;FIRE-BASEL;Fire-Switzerland;JUL;2023;6;7;;;;;;;248;10.3390/fire6070248;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fire6070248;;;21;"Ecology; Forestry";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry";N3KS4;;gold;;;2024-04-12;WOS:001036048300001;View Full Record in Web of Science

In addition, diesel power plants require regular maintenance, have a relatively short service life during continuous operation and produce a large amount of emissions into the environment. This article discusses various methods of placing solar panels in the space for the autonomous power supply of weather station equipment. The principles of these methods are described and their advantages and disadvantages are outlined. The optimal algorithms of functioning for photomodules are described and their comparison regarding the main, significant parameters is carried out. The choice of the most effective algorithm for use at a weather station is made. The effective positioning of solar panels is also calculated, and positioning conditions are determined depending on the territorial location and various environmental conditions. Simulation of the power supply system of a weather station consisting of solar panels, batteries and inverters is performed. As a result, a practical example of the application of the method of selecting the optimal composition of equipment for a hybrid power system of a weather station territorially located in Siberia with different configurations of equipment is considered. In numerical terms, it was possible to reduce the cost of power equipment operation by more than 60% with a fairly low payback period of 5.5 years and an increased reliability of the power system, which is very important for autonomous power systems of northern weather stations.;"[Malozyomov, Boris V.

There is a good agreement with the experimental data in a broad range of laser intensities from I = 10(18) W/cm(2) to I = 10(19) W/cm(2) at the fixed laser pulse duration. The obtained parameters of proton beams were used for calculation of the total yield of a particles and neutrons for the nuclear reactions B-11(p, 3a) and B-11(p, n)C-11 at the collisions of proton beams with boron targets. It is shown that the number of a particles escaping boron target and arriving at track detectors is less than 5% of the total amount of a particles, because the majority of these particles remain inside the target owing to ionization losses. The derived values of the yield of a particles' which arrive at detectors are in good agreement with the experimental data. We also calculate the total yield of neutrons in the reaction B-11(p, n)C-11. It is found that, at the intensity I = 10(19) W/cm(2) of the picosecond laser pulse, the yield is equal to N-n = 1.4 x 10(8), this value is approximately of 3% of the total yield of a particles.;"[Andreev, S.

Ultrathin nonwoven fabrics are produced for many applications: biomedical, nanosensors, tissue engineering and filtration systems. In this work, nonwoven polylactide, polylactide/natural rubber, poly-3-hydroxybutyrate, and poly-3-hydroxybutyrate/nitrile butadiene rubber fabrics were prepared by electrospinning methods. The obtained fabric samples were used as substrates for the growth of winter wheat seeds Yubileinaya 100 (Triticum aestivum L.). The stimulating effect of polymer substrates on seed germination and plant growth was shown. The structure and properties of nonwoven agromaterials were controlled by differential scanning calorimetry, IR-spectroscopy, and optical microscopy. The mechanical properties of the obtained fabrics before and after their utilization as substrates were studied. After the wheat growing experiment, the degree of crystallinity of PHB and PHB/NBR samples decreased by 12% and they completely lost their mechanical properties. It is shown that the main factors providing the efficiency of seed growth technology on polymer substrates are the chemical nature and structure of the biodegradable matrix.;"[Tertyshnaya, Yulia Victorovna; Podzorova, Maria Victorovna; Varyan, Ivetta Aramovna] Russian Acad Sci, Emanuel Inst Biochem Phys, 4 Kosygina Str, Moscow 119334, Russia; [Tertyshnaya, Yulia Victorovna; Podzorova, Maria Victorovna; Varyan, Ivetta Aramovna] Plekhanov Russian Univ Econ, Lab Adv Composite Mat & Technol, 36 Stremyanny per, Moscow 117997, Russia; [Tertyshnaya, Yulia Victorovna; Podzorova, Maria Victorovna] Fed Res Agroengn Ctr VIM, 1st Institutskiy Proezd,5, Moscow 109428, Russia; [Tcherdyntsev, Victor Victorovich; Zadorozhnyy, Mikhail Yurievich] Natl Univ Sci & Technol MISIS, Lab Funct Polymer Mat, Leninskii prosp,4, Moscow 119049, Russia; [Zadorozhnyy, Mikhail Yurievich] Moscow Polytech Univ, Ctr Project Act, Bolshaya Semenovskaya st,2, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Medvedeva, Elena Valerievna] Moscow Inst Aviat Technol, Volokolamsk sh,4, Moscow 125993, Russia";"Russian Academy of Sciences; Emanuel Institute of Biochemical Physics; Plekhanov Russian University of Economics; National University of Science & Technology (MISIS); Moscow Polytechnic University; Moscow Aviation Institute";"Podzorova, MV (corresponding author), Russian Acad Sci, Emanuel Inst Biochem Phys, 4 Kosygina Str, Moscow 119334, Russia.;Podzorova, MV (corresponding author), Plekhanov Russian Univ Econ, Lab Adv Composite Mat & Technol, 36 Stremyanny per, Moscow 117997, Russia.;Podzorova, MV (corresponding author), Fed Res Agroengn Ctr VIM, 1st Institutskiy Proezd,5, Moscow 109428, Russia.;Tcherdyntsev, VV (corresponding author), Natl Univ Sci & Technol MISIS, Lab Funct Polymer Mat, Leninskii prosp,4, Moscow 119049, Russia.";"mariapdz@mail.ru; vvch@misis.ru";"Tcherdyntsev, Victor V/E-4270-2014; Podzorova, Mariya/E-4305-2016; Zadorozhnyy, Mikhail/A-7111-2014";"Tertyshnaya, Yulia/0000-0001-8886-4513; Podzorova, Mariya/0000-0001-9023-3876; Zadorozhnyy, Mikhail/0000-0001-8776-0595; Tcherdyntsev, Victor/0000-0003-4357-4509";"Ministry of Science and Higher Education of Russia [075-00268-20-02]; Moscow Polytechnic University; [718/20]; [0718-2020-0036]";"Ministry of Science and Higher Education of Russia; Moscow Polytechnic University; ;";The work was carried out using the scientific equipment of the Center of Shared Usage New Materials and Technologies of the Emanuel Institute of Biochemical Physics RAS and the Joint Research Center of the Plekhanov Russian University of Economics.

By deploying the IRS on drones, it becomes possible to improve the coverage and reliability of the communication network while reducing energy consumption and costs. Furthermore, integrating IRS with Federated Learning (FL) can further boost the performance of the drone network by enabling collaborative learning among multiple drones, leading to better and more efficient decision-making and holding great promise for enabling 6G communication networks. Therefore, we present a novel framework for FL meets IRS in drones for enabling 6G. In this framework, multiple IRS-equipped drone swarm are deployed to form a distributed wireless network, where FL techniques are used to collaborate with the learning process and optimize the reflection coefficients of each drone-IRS. This allows drone swarm to adapt to changing communication environments and improve the coverage and quality of wireless communication services. Integrating FL and IRS into drones offers several advantages over traditional wireless communication networks, including rapid deployment in emergencies or disasters, improved coverage and quality of communication services, and increased accessibility to remote areas. Finally, we highlight the challenges and opportunities of integrating FL and IRS into drones for researchers interested in drone networks. We also help drive innovation in developing 6G communication networks.;"[Shvetsov, Alexey V.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Smart Technol, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Alsamhi, Saeed Hamood; Alammari, Amr A.; Nashwan, Farhan M.

The effects of CeO2 addition on the crystal structure and high-temperature conductivity of the crystals have been investigated. According to X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy, it was found that Ce cations in crystals are present mainly as Ce4+ ions. The study of the grown crystals by X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy showed that all the grown crystals were single-phase and had either a tetragonal t`` or cubic structure, the latter having crystals containing 10 mol% Y2O3 and doped with CeO2. Doping of the crystals with CeO2 was accompanied by a linear increase in the lattice parameter. This indicates the entry of CeO2 into the crystal lattice with the formation of a solid solution. The study of the ionic conductivity of crystals by impedance spectroscopy in the temperature range 400-900 degrees C showed that the substitution of Zr4+ ions with Ce4+ ions manifests itself in different ways and can either increase or decrease the value of high-temperature conductivity depending on the content of stabilizing yttrium oxide.

Through DR programs, users are encouraged for utilizing renewable energy and reducing their power consumption at peak times, thereby helping to balance supply and demand on the grid, as well as generating revenue from the sale of excess power. This paper presents an effective energy management layout (EML) for household DR employing Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Fuzzy Reasoning (FR). RL would be a model-free control method that consists of doing measures and assessing the outcomes as it interacts with the environments. Through direct integration of customer feedback into its control logic, the suggested method takes into account user satisfaction by utilizing FR as a reward function. Through the shift of controllable devices from peak hours, whenever energy cost is higher, to off-peak periods, whenever energy cost is low, Q-learning, an RL method according to a reward scheme, has been applied for scheduling the execution of smart home devices. With the suggested method, 14 home devices can be controlled by one agent, and many status-action pairs as well as fuzzy logic for the reward function are used to assess the actions taken for a particular status. Simulations are implemented in the digital twin envi-ronment and demonstrate that the suggested device planning method smooths the energy usage and minimizes the energy price by taking into account the consumers' satisfaction, the consumers' feedback, and their satis-faction settings. The Home EML has been presented with a consumer interface in MATLAB/Simulink for demonstrating the suggested DR approach. The simulation tools include smart devices, energy price signals, smart meters, solar photovoltaics, batteries, electric vehicle, and grid supply.;"[Liu, Huafeng; Liu, Qine] State Grid Hubei Xiangyang Power Supply Co, Xiangyang 441000, Peoples R China; [Rao, Chaoping] Wuhan Qingchuan Univ, Coll Mech & Elect Engn, Wuhan 430204, Peoples R China; [Wang, Fei] State Grid Hubei Jingmen Power Supply Co, Jingmen 448000, Peoples R China; [Alsokhiry, Fahad] King Abdulaziz Univ, Fac Engn, Dept Elect & Comp Engn, Jeddah 21589, Saudi Arabia; [V.

The MMFET uses the microcantilevers MC as a mechanically floating gate and the movable mirror of the Michelson optical interferometer. The MC mechanical oscillations are transformed into optical signals and the MMFET operates as the detector of THz radiation with the optical output. The combination of the mechanical and plasmonic resonances in the MMFET with the optical amplification enables an effective THz detection.;"[Ryzhii, V.; Tang, C.; Otsuji, T.] Tohoku Univ, Res Inst Elect Commun, Sendai 9808577, Japan; [Tang, C.] Tohoku Univ, Frontier Res Inst Interdisciplinary Sci, Sendai 9808578, Japan; [Ryzhii, M.] Univ Aizu, Dept Comp Sci & Engn, Aizu Wakamatsu 9658580, Japan; [Kalenkov, S.

Modern-day time-domain photometric surveys collect a lot of observations of various astronomical objects and the coming era of large-scale surveys will provide even more information on their properties. Spectroscopic follow-ups are especially crucial for transients such as supernovae and most of these objects have not been subject to such studies. Aims. Flux time series are actively used as an affordable alternative for photometric classification and characterization, for instance, peak identifications and luminosity decline estimations. However, the collected time series are multidimensional and irregularly sampled, while also containing outliers and without any well-defined systematic uncertainties. This paper presents a search for the best-performing methods to approximate the observed light curves over time and wavelength for the purpose of generating time series with regular time steps in each passband. Methods. We examined several light curve approximation methods based on neural networks such as multilayer perceptrons, Bayesian neural networks, and normalizing flows to approximate observations of a single light curve. Test datasets include simulated PLAsTiCC and real Zwicky Transient Facility Bright Transient Survey light curves of transients. Results. The tests demonstrate that even just a few observations are enough to fit the networks and improve the quality of approximation, compared to state-of-the-art models. The methods described in this work have a low computational complexity and are significantly faster than Gaussian processes. Additionally, we analyzed the performance of the approximation techniques from the perspective of further peak identification and transients classification.

Most of the techniques used for this purpose are based on theoretical studies. These studies suggest that the observed diffraction patterns are caused by random stacking faults in crystals. In reality, however, the condition of randomness for stacking faults may be violated. The purpose of the study was to develop a technique that can be used to calculate the diffraction effects of the axis of the thin plates of twin, new phases, as well as other variations in defective structures. Materials and methods. This was achieved through modern X-ray diffraction methods using differential equations (transformations and Fourier transforms) and the construction of the Ewald sphere, mathematical analysis, mathematical logic, and mathematical modeling (complex Markov chain). Conclusion. The study made it possible to develop a technique for the calculation of the diffraction effects of the axis of the thin plates of twin, new phases and other variations in defective structures. The technique makes it possible to solve several complex, urgent problems related to the calculation of X-ray diffraction for crystals with face-centered lattices containing different types of stacking faults. At the same time, special attention was paid to the correlations between the relative positions of faults. The calculations showed that the proposed method can help to determine the nature and structure of stacking faults by identifying the partial and vertex dislocations limiting them in twin crystals with a face-centered cubic structure of silicon carbide based on X-ray diffraction analysis.;"[Bosikov, Igor I.

AMC with 0.5 wt% nanodiamonds addition was prepared by mechanical mixing, while AMC with 0.5 wt% of multi-layered graphene was prepared by electrochemical deposition. Initial powders for LPBF were thoroughly characterized and op-timal LPBF parameters were found based on the relative density analysis and optical microscopy. Processing windows of both AMCs moved towards lower energy density possibly due to the increased total absorptivity of the powders. Raman spectroscopy results, SEM and HRTEM studies of samples after LPBF demonstrated the absence of nano-diamond in the structure after processing which is explained by graphitization of the nanodiamond particles during laser melting. In case of AMC with graphene additives, carbon-containing particles remained in the structure with partial in situ formation of Al4C3, along with a noticeable strengthening effect, which increased material's microhardness by more than 40% compared to the initial AlSi10Mg alloy. The strengthening effect is explained by the presence of a network of graphene and Al4C3 particles across the solidified melt-pool promoting the Orowan strengthening mechanism. (c) 2023 The Authors.

Methods and materials: The article considers the developed mathematical model of vertical oscillations of the monorail track, which allows setting the interconnection between the rolling stock parameters and dynamic loads in the suspension. At vertical oscillations of the monorail and under the effect of harmonic disturbing force caused by the movement of the suspension, the system of the monorail suspension can be represented in the form of a dual-mass system. Results: As a result, the equations for oscillation amplitudes of the monorail elements were obtained and damping coefficient of suspension was defined. The obtained results suggest setting reasonable parameters of the monorail fastening, which offers the possibility to decrease dynamic loads occurring during the operation of the mine suspended monorail tracks. The proposed monorail suspension makes it possible to reduce the dynamic loads formed during the movement of the rolling stock by 30-40% and can be used to modernize existing mine suspended monorails. Discussion: Analysis of the obtained results shows that in order to reduce the vibration amplitudes of a suspended monorail mine, it is appropriate to use suspension systems for rolling stock and a monorail track, consisting of elastic elements. The parameters required for this can be determined using the proposed method, and required rigidity of the monorail track is provided by embedding elastic supports into its suspension system. Conclusions: The obtained results allow setting reasonable parameters of the monorail fastening of the mine suspended monorail tracks. The proposed monorail suspension makes it possible to minimize the dynamic loads formed during the movement of rolling stock and can be used to modernize existing mine suspension monorails.;"[Gutarevich, Viktor O.] Russian Acad Sci, Sci Dept, Kh Ibragimov Complex Inst, Staropromyslovskoe Ave 21, Grozny 364906, Russia; [Martyushev, Nikita V.] Tomsk Polytech Univ, Dept Adv Technol, 30 Lenin Ave, Tomsk 634050, Russia; [Klyuev, Roman V.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Tech & Technol Min & Oil & Gas Prod Dept, 33 B Semenovskaya Str, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Kukartsev, Viktor A.] Siberian Fed Univ, Polytech Inst, Dept Mat Sci & Mat Proc Technol, Krasnoyarsk 660041, Russia; [Kukartsev, Vladislav V.] Siberian Fed Univ, Inst Space & Informat Technol, Dept Informat, Krasnoyarsk 660041, Russia; [Kukartsev, Vladislav V.] Reshetnev Siberian State Univ Sci & Technol, Inst Engn & Econ, Dept Informat Econ Syst, Krasnoyarsk 660037, Russia; [Kukartsev, Vladislav V.] Bauman Moscow State Tech Univ, Digital Mat Sci New Mat & Technol, Moscow 105005, Russia; [Iushkova, Liudmila V.] Siberian Fed Univ, Dept Business & Mkt, Krasnoyarsk 660041, Russia; [Iushkova, Liudmila V.] Minist Emergency Situat Russia, Dept State & Municipal Adm, Siberian Fire & Rescue Acad State Fire Serv, Zheleznogorsk 662972, Russia; [Korpacheva, Larisa N.] Siberian Fed Univ, Inst Business Proc Management, Dept Digital Management Technol, Krasnoyarsk 660041, Russia";"Russian Academy of Sciences; Ibragimov Complex Research Institute; Tomsk Polytechnic University; Moscow Polytechnic University; Siberian Federal University; Siberian Federal University; Reshetnev Siberian State University of Science & Technology; Bauman Moscow State Technical University; Siberian Federal University; Siberian Federal University";Martyushev, NV (corresponding author), Tomsk Polytech Univ, Dept Adv Technol, 30 Lenin Ave, Tomsk 634050, Russia.;"viktor.gutarevich@mail.ru; martjushev@tpu.ru";"Kukartsev, Vladislav/U-6956-2019; Klyuev, Roman Vladimirovich/AAX-6549-2021; Klyuev, Roman/J-8000-2014; Tynchenko, Vadim/N-5468-2016; Gutarevych, Viktor/A-2783-2016; Martyushev, Nikita/AAO-2653-2020";"Kukartsev, Vladislav/0000-0001-6382-1736; Klyuev, Roman Vladimirovich/0000-0003-3777-7203; Klyuev, Roman/0000-0003-3777-7203; Tynchenko, Vadim/0000-0002-3959-2969; Gutarevych, Viktor/0000-0002-6294-5232; Martyushev, Nikita/0000-0003-0620-9561";;;;;24;5;5;9;17;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;2076-3417;;APPL SCI-BASEL;Appl.

One of the critical concerns, however, is the spectrum scarcity, due to the unprecedented broadcast penetration rate nowadays. Based on this, visible light communication (VLC) has recently emerged as a viable solution to secure high-speed communications. VLC, a high data rate communication technology, has proven its stature as a promising complementary to its radio frequency (RF) counterpart. VLC is a cost-effective, energy-efficient, and secure technology that exploits the current infrastructure, specifically within indoor and underwater environments. Yet, despite their appealing capabilities, VLC systems face several limitations which constraint their potentials such as LED's limited bandwidth, dimming, flickering, line-of-sight (LOS) requirement, impact of harsh weather conditions, noise, interference, shadowing, transceiver alignment, signal decoding complexity, and mobility issue. Consequently, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has been considered an effective technique to circumvent these shortcomings. The NOMA scheme has emerged as a revolutionary paradigm to address the shortcomings of VLC systems. The potentials of NOMA are to increase the number of users, system's capacity, massive connectivity, and enhance the spectrum and energy efficiency in future communication scenarios. Motivated by this, the presented study offers an overview of NOMA-based VLC systems. This article provides a broad scope of existing research activities of NOMA-based VLC systems. This article aims to provide firsthand knowledge of the prominence of NOMA and VLC and surveys several NOMA-enabled VLC systems. We briefly highlight the potential and capabilities of NOMA-based VLC systems. In addition, we outline the integration of such systems with several emerging technologies such as intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS), orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Furthermore, we focus on NOMA-based hybrid RF/VLC networks and discuss the role of machine learning (ML) tools and physical layer security (PLS) in this domain.

The developed method for screen printing provides the formation of polycrystalline films of a specified area per cycle, provided that there is a possibility for varying their thickness from tens of microns to units, which allows reducing the solar cell's thickness and facilitating the process of its connection with the substrate. Therefore, the application of the films to a sitall substrate by screen printing contributes to reducing the product weight and facilitating the process of joining sheet materials intended for solar panels, namely attaching the lasing element to the substrate. The purpose of this work is to study the morphological peculiarities of polycrystalline CdS1-xSex films obtained by an optimized screen-printing method and to create a model of their formation process. The structural and morphological peculiarities of the samples were studied using electron microscopy, AFM, XPA, and XFS. As a result of the work, based on the obtained experimental data, a model of the film formation process was developed.

Improvement of the start-up system of the main diesel locomotive when using a supercapacitor allows multiple restarts of diesel locomotives, meaning that the operation of the diesel locomotive can be stopped several times without wasting fuel in idle operations. In this study, we simulated the electric starting circuit of a diesel locomotive with a block of supercapacitors using the Matlab Simulink program. The simulation results show that using only a supercapacitor in the start-up system is impossible. Even though the supercapacitor produces the required current and voltage, its operating time is extremely insufficient. Using a storage battery along with a supercapacitor in the diesel locomotive start-up system is most effective. This reduces the peak current load on the standard battery. The article suggests an effective principle for starting a mainline diesel locomotive and provides an effective circuit solution involving a supercapacitor. Based on the booster stabilizer scheme, a new scheme was modeled to study the successful launch of a diesel locomotive that has various start-up systems. Applying a supercapacitor in the start-up system of a main diesel locomotive is proposed and the results of its use are presented. In addition, this study defines the basic requirements for using a system based on a battery in conjunction with a supercapacitor. Characteristics such as the temperature range of the system are shown.;"[Malozyomov, Boris V.] Novosibirsk State Tech Univ, Dept Electrotech Complexes, 20,Karl Marks Ave, Novosibirsk 630073, Russia; [Martyushev, Nikita V.] Tomsk Polytech Univ, Dept Adv Technol, Tomsk 634050, Russia; [Kukartsev, Viktor Alekseevich] Siberian Fed Univ, Polytech Inst, Dept Mat Sci & Mat Proc Technol, Krasnoyarsk 660041, Russia; [Kukartsev, Vladislav Viktorovich] Siberian Fed Univ, Inst Space & Informat Technol, Dept Informat, Krasnoyarsk 660041, Russia; [Kukartsev, Vladislav Viktorovich] Reshetnev Siberian State Univ Sci & Technol, Inst Engn & Econ, Dept Informat Econ Syst, Krasnoyarsk 660037, Russia; [Kukartsev, Vladislav Viktorovich] Bauman Moscow State Tech Univ, Digital Mat Sci New Mat & Technol, Moscow 105005, Russia; [Tynchenko, Sergei Vasilievich] Siberian Fed Univ, Inst Business Proc Management, Dept Digital Control Technol, Krasnoyarsk 660041, Russia; [Tynchenko, Sergei Vasilievich] Reshetnev Siberian State Univ Sci & Technol, Inst Comp Sci & Telecommun, Dept Comp Sci & Comp Engn, Krasnoyarsk 660037, Russia; [Klyuev, Roman V.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Tech & Technol Min & Oil & Gas Prod Dept, 33, B Semenovskaya Str, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Zagorodnii, Nikolay A.] Belgorod State Technol Univ, Dept Operat, Kostukov St, Belgorod 308012, Russia; [Zagorodnii, Nikolay A.] Belgorod State Technol Univ, Org Vehicle Traff, Kostukov St, Belgorod 308012, Russia; Siberian Fed Univ, Lab Biofuel Composit, Krasnoyarsk 660041, Russia; Reshetnev Siberian State Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Syst Anal & Operat Res, Krasnoyarsk 660037, Russia";"Novosibirsk State Technical University; Tomsk Polytechnic University; Siberian Federal University; Siberian Federal University; Reshetnev Siberian State University of Science & Technology; Bauman Moscow State Technical University; Siberian Federal University; Reshetnev Siberian State University of Science & Technology; Moscow Polytechnic University; Belgorod State Technological University; Belgorod State Technological University; Siberian Federal University; Reshetnev Siberian State University of Science & Technology";Klyuev, RV (corresponding author), Moscow Polytech Univ, Tech & Technol Min & Oil & Gas Prod Dept, 33, B Semenovskaya Str, Moscow 107023, Russia.;"borisnovel@mail.ru; kluev-roman@rambler.ru";"Klyuev, Roman/J-8000-2014; Malozyomov, Boris V./J-1723-2016; Kukartsev, Vladislav/U-6956-2019; Tynchenko, Vadim/N-5468-2016; Klyuev, Roman Vladimirovich/AAX-6549-2021; Martyushev, Nikita/AAO-2653-2020";"Klyuev, Roman/0000-0003-3777-7203; Malozyomov, Boris V./0000-0001-8686-9556; Kukartsev, Vladislav/0000-0001-6382-1736; Tynchenko, Vadim/0000-0002-3959-2969; Klyuev, Roman Vladimirovich/0000-0003-3777-7203; Martyushev, Nikita/0000-0003-0620-9561";;;;;48;12;12;4;8;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;1996-1073;;ENERGIES;Energies;MAY 5;2023;16;9;;;;;;;3909;10.3390/en16093909;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en16093909;;;24;Energy & Fuels;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Energy & Fuels;G2AP8;;gold;;;2024-04-12;WOS:000987252300001;View Full Record in Web of Science

The aim of the study is to improve the processes of blade processing of small-sized parts made of beryllium bronze and the 29 NK alloy to provide rational conditions for thermal pulse deburring. Surface samples were experimentally obtained after turning in different modes on a CITIZEN CINCOM K16E-VII automatic lathe equipped with an Applitec micromechanics tool. The surface quality and burr characteristics were examined using a JEOL JIB-Z4500 electron microscope and a ContourGT-K optical profilometer. The program Statistica 6 allowed processing of the results. The relationship between the parameters of the turning mode and the thickness of the root of the burrs formed on the machined surface, the limitation of which is one of the conditions for the application of the thermal pulse method, was established. The obtained empirical regression dependencies establish a rational range of cutting mode parameters, and the implementation of the formulated recommendations for setting blade modes ensures deburring by the thermal pulse method in compliance with the requirements of drawing under maximum processing performance.;"[Martyushev, Nikita V.] Tomsk Polytech Univ, Dept Adv Technol, Tomsk 634050, Russia; [Bublik, Dmitriy A.] Irkutsk Natl Res Tech Univ, Inst Informat Technol & Data Anal, Dept Thermal Power Engn, Irkutsk 664074, Russia; [Kukartsev, Vladislav V.] Siberian Fed Univ, Inst Space & Informat Technol, Dept Informat, Krasnoyarsk 660041, Russia; [Kukartsev, Vladislav V.] Reshetnev Siberian State Univ Sci & Technol, Inst Engn & Econ, Dept Informat Econ Syst, Krasnoyarsk 660037, Russia; [Kukartsev, Vladislav V.; Tynchenko, Vadim S.] Bauman Moscow State Tech Univ, Digital Mat Sci New Mat & Technol, Moscow 105005, Russia; [Tynchenko, Vadim S.] Siberian Fed Univ, Sch Petr & Nat Gas Engn, Dept Technol Machines & Equipment Oil & Gas Comple, Krasnoyarsk 660041, Russia; [Tynchenko, Vadim S.] Reshetnev Siberian State Univ Sci & Technol, Inst Comp Sci & Telecommun, Informat Control Syst Dept, Krasnoyarsk 660037, Russia; [Klyuev, Roman V.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Tech & Technol Min & Oil & Gas Prod Dept, 33 B Semenovskaya Str, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Tynchenko, Yadviga A.] Siberian Fed Univ, Lab Biofuel Composit, Krasnoyarsk 660041, Russia; [Tynchenko, Yadviga A.] Reshetnev Siberian State Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Syst Anal & Operat Res, Krasnoyarsk 660037, Russia; Moscow State Univ Civil Engn, Stroytest Res & Testing Ctr, 26 Yaroslavskoe Highway, Moscow 129337, Russia";"Tomsk Polytechnic University; Irkutsk National Research Technical University (INRTU); Siberian Federal University; Reshetnev Siberian State University of Science & Technology; Bauman Moscow State Technical University; Siberian Federal University; Reshetnev Siberian State University of Science & Technology; Moscow Polytechnic University; Siberian Federal University; Reshetnev Siberian State University of Science & Technology; Moscow State University of Civil Engineering";Martyushev, NV (corresponding author), Tomsk Polytech Univ, Dept Adv Technol, Tomsk 634050, Russia.;martjushev@tpu.ru;"Yu, Karlina/AAP-4915-2021; Kukartsev, Vladislav/U-6956-2019; Klyuev, Roman Vladimirovich/AAX-6549-2021; Klyuev, Roman/J-8000-2014; Tynchenko, Vadim/N-5468-2016; Martyushev, Nikita/AAO-2653-2020";"Yu, Karlina/0000-0001-6519-561X; Kukartsev, Vladislav/0000-0001-6382-1736; Klyuev, Roman Vladimirovich/0000-0003-3777-7203; Klyuev, Roman/0000-0003-3777-7203; Tynchenko, Vadim/0000-0002-3959-2969; Martyushev, Nikita/0000-0003-0620-9561";;;;;25;7;7;1;3;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;1996-1944;;MATERIALS;Materials;APR 30;2023;16;9;;;;;;;3490;10.3390/ma16093490;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ma16093490;;;20;"Chemistry, Physical; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering; Physics, Applied; Physics, Condensed Matter";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Chemistry; Materials Science; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering; Physics";G2PX5;37176372;Green Published, gold;;;2024-04-12;WOS:000987650400001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Known problems of deep underground mining do not allow for realizing the potential of man-made gas reservoirs due to the deterioration of the conditions of development of reserves of georesources. The aim of the work was to improve recommendations for the substantiation of drilling parameters for undermined drainage boreholes for increasing methane production from unconventional coal-gas collectors. The authors' approach innovation lies in the possibility of using the established patterns of better natural stability of undermined boreholes to optimize them as spatial orientation parameters in an existing drilling passport for the improvement of methane extraction productivity. For this purpose, smoothing (LOESS) of the experimental data of two similar types of wells was used; then deterministic interpolation methods in combination with a three-dimensional representation of the response function in gnuplot were used. As a result, it was found that the increase in the inclination angle from 40 degrees to 60 degrees leads to a significant transformation of the model of the studied process, accompanied by a decline in the dynamics of methane emission and a decrease in the distance of the productive work zone of this type of well from 13 to 5 m before the roof landing, which then is replaced by a sharp increase in the productive work zone up to 35 m ahead of the longwall face. This allows under specific conditions for recommending increasing the productivity of methane capex from technogenic disturbed coal-gas reservoir replacement of wells with a smaller angle of rise to the transition to a more frequent grid of clusters from wells #4.";"[Malozyomov, Boris V.] Novosibirsk State Tech Univ, Dept Electrotech Complexes, 20,Karla Marksa Ave, Novosibirsk 630073, Russia; [Golik, Vladimir Ivanovich] Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Tech & Technol Min & Oil & Gas Prod, 38,B Semenovskaya St, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Brigida, Vladimir] RUDN Univ, Dept Biomed Vet & Ecol Direct, 6,Miklukho Maklaya St, Moscow 117198, Russia; [Brigida, Vladimir] Russian Acad Sci, Fed Res Ctr Subtrop Sci Ctr, Soci 354002, Russia; [Kukartsev, Vladislav V.] Reshetnev Siberian State Univ Sci & Technol, Inst Engn & Econ, Dept Informat Econ Syst, Krasnoyarsk 660037, Russia; [Kukartsev, Vladislav V.] Siberian Fed Univ, Inst Space & Informat Technol, Dept Informat, Krasnoyarsk 660041, Russia; [Kukartsev, Vladislav V.; Boyko, Andrey A.] Bauman Moscow State Tech Univ, Digital Mat Science New Mat & Technol, Moscow 105005, Russia; [Tynchenko, Yadviga A.] Siberian Fed Univ, Lab Biofuel Composit, Krasnoyarsk 660041, Russia; [Tynchenko, Yadviga A.] Reshetnev Siberian State Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Syst Anal & Operat Res, Krasnoyarsk 660037, Russia; [Boyko, Andrey A.] Siberian Fed Univ, Sch Petr & Nat Gas Engn, Dept Technol Machines & Equipment Oil & Gas Comple, Krasnoyarsk 660041, Russia; [Boyko, Andrey A.] Reshetnev Siberian State Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Management, Krasnoyarsk 660037, Russia; [Tynchenko, Sergey V.] Siberian Fed Univ, Inst Business Proc Management, Dept Digital Control Technol, Krasnoyarsk 660041, Russia; [Tynchenko, Sergey V.] Reshetnev Siberian State Univ Sci & Technol, Inst Comp Sci & Telecommun, Dept Comp Sci & Comp Engn, Krasnoyarsk 660037, Russia";"Novosibirsk State Technical University; Moscow Polytechnic University; Peoples Friendship University of Russia; Russian Academy of Sciences; Reshetnev Siberian State University of Science & Technology; Siberian Federal University; Bauman Moscow State Technical University; Siberian Federal University; Reshetnev Siberian State University of Science & Technology; Siberian Federal University; Reshetnev Siberian State University of Science & Technology; Siberian Federal University; Reshetnev Siberian State University of Science & Technology";Malozyomov, BV (corresponding author), Novosibirsk State Tech Univ, Dept Electrotech Complexes, 20,Karla Marksa Ave, Novosibirsk 630073, Russia.;"borisnovel@mail.ru; v.i.golik@mail.ru; 1z011@inbox.ru; vlad_saa_2000@mail.ru; t080801@yandex.ru; eboiko@sfu-kras.ru; stynchenko@sfu-kras.ru";"Malozyomov, Boris V./J-1723-2016; Kukartsev, Vladislav/U-6956-2019; Brigida, Vladimir/G-6933-2018";"Malozyomov, Boris V./0000-0001-8686-9556; Kukartsev, Vladislav/0000-0001-6382-1736; Brigida, Vladimir/0000-0002-9421-5613";state assignment research of FRC SSC RAS [FGRW-2021-0015, 122032300363-3];state assignment research of FRC SSC RAS;The study was funded by the state assignment research of FRC SSC RAS FGRW-2021-0015, project No 122032300363-3 (Brigida V., designing of the author's approach to modeling nonlinear processes).;;110;17;17;14;24;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;1996-1073;;ENERGIES;Energies;MAY 23;2023;16;11;;;;;;;4276;10.3390/en16114276;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en16114276;;;16;Energy & Fuels;Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);Energy & Fuels;I6VU0;;gold;;;2024-04-12;WOS:001004149900001;View Full Record in Web of Science

Disturbance of chemical signaling is accompanied by several diseases such as ischemia, trauma, and neurodegenerative diseases. It is known that the disturbance of chemical signaling, like that caused by glutamate excitotoxicity, leads to the structural reorganization of the cytoskeleton of neuronal cells and the deviation of native mechanical properties. Thus, to investigate the mechanical properties of living neuronal cells in the presence of glutamate, it is crucial to use noncontact and low-stress methods, which are the advantages of scanning ion-conductance microscopy (SICM). Moreover, a nanopipette may be used for the local delivery of small molecules as well as for a probe. In this work, SICM was used as an advanced technique for the simultaneous local delivery of glutamate and investigation of living neuronal cell morphology and mechanical behavior caused by an excitotoxic effect of glutamate.;"[Kolmogorov, Vasilii; Erofeev, Alexander; Vaneev, Alexander; Gorelkin, Petr] Natl Univ Sci & Technol MISiS, Res Lab Biophys, Moscow 119049, Russia; [Kolmogorov, Vasilii; Vaneev, Alexander; Klyachko, Natalia] Lomonosov Moscow State Univ, Fac Chem, Moscow 119991, Russia; [Gorbacheva, Lyubov] Lomonosov Moscow State Univ, Fac Biol, Moscow 119991, Russia; [Gorbacheva, Lyubov] Pirogov Russian Natl Res Med Univ, Fac Biomed, Moscow 117997, Russia; [Kolesov, Dmitry] Moscow Polytech Univ, Res Lab SPM, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Korchev, Yuri] Imperial Coll London, Dept Med, London SW7 2BX, England; [Korchev, Yuri] Kanazawa Univ, Nano Life Sci Inst WPI NanoLSI, Kanazawa 9201192, Japan";"National University of Science & Technology (MISIS); Lomonosov Moscow State University; Lomonosov Moscow State University; Pirogov Russian National Research Medical University; Moscow Polytechnic University; Imperial College London; Kanazawa University";Gorelkin, P (corresponding author), Natl Univ Sci & Technol MISiS, Res Lab Biophys, Moscow 119049, Russia.;peter.gorelkin@gmail.com;;"Kolmogorov, Vasilii/0000-0002-7135-8910; Kolesov, Dmitriy/0000-0003-0270-2893; Gorbacheva, Liubov/0000-0002-3910-8831; Vaneev, Alexander/0000-0001-8201-8498";"The study was performed employing a unique scientific facility Scanning ion-conductance microscope with a confocal module (registration number 2512530) and was financially supported by the Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation, Agre [2512530]; Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation [075-15-2022-264]; World Premier International Research Center Initiative (WPI) from the MEXT of Japan";"The study was performed employing a unique scientific facility Scanning ion-conductance microscope with a confocal module (registration number 2512530) and was financially supported by the Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation, Agre; Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation(Ministry of Education and Science, Russian Federation); World Premier International Research Center Initiative (WPI) from the MEXT of Japan(Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT))";The study was performed employing a unique scientific facility Scanning ion-conductance microscope with a confocal module (registration number 2512530) and was financially supported by the Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation, Agreement No. 075-15-2022-264.

The fire hazard increases with an increase in the mining depth. Currently, most accidents in coal mines are mine fires. The cost of eliminating mine fires is 80-95% of the cost of eliminating all accidents occurring at mining enterprises. Therefore, the problem of developing a new methodology for modeling the ventilation network parameters of the mine to increase the reliability of controlling the aerogas mode at the excavation site is very relevant. The comprehensive analysis and assessment of gas-dynamic processes in coalmines under study were carried out using the methods of probability theory and mathematical statistics. Spatial data were processed using spline interpolation in gnuplot. As a result, a generalized expression for the transfer functions of coalmine objects, taking into account delays, was developed, including the description of dynamic properties of mining sites under various operating modes. The principal possibility of using a graphical method for estimating additional parameters of the sections of the ventilation system branches has been proved due to the alignment of their profiles at an equivalent distance relative to an arbitrary analogue. The improved method of spatial modeling was used to determine the gas-dynamic characteristics through additive gas-dynamic processes. The studies have been carried out and the method for managing the process of changing connections between devices (controllers-switches) of the technical system was developed in order to obtain greater reliability for safe mining. In subsequent studies, there is an issue of more detailed clarification of the peculiarities concerning the interrelations between the studied parameters in several projections of the response space.;"[Bosikov, Igor Ivanovich] State Technol Univ, North Caucasian Inst Min & Met, Dept Informat Technol & Syst, 44 Nikolaev Str, Vladikavkaz 362011, Russia; [Martyushev, Nikita V.] Tomsk Polytech Univ, Dept Adv Technol, 30 Lenin Ave, Tomsk 634050, Russia; [Klyuev, Roman V.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Tech & Technol Min & Oil & Gas Prod Dept, 33 B Semenovskaya Str, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Savchenko, Irina A.] Moscow City Univ, Dept Philosophy & Social Sci, Moscow 129226, Russia; [Savchenko, Irina A.] Linguist Univ Nizhny Novgorod, Int Lab Res Methods Social Sci, Nizhnii Novgorod 603155, Russia; [Kukartsev, Vladislav V.] Reshetnev Siberian State Univ Sci & Technol, Inst Engn & Econ, Dept Informat Econ Syst, Krasnoyarsk 660037, Russia; [Kukartsev, Vladislav V.] Siberian Fed Univ, Inst Space & Informat Technol, Dept Informat, Krasnoyarsk 660041, Russia; [Kukartsev, Vladislav V.] Bauman Moscow State Tech Univ, Digital Mat Sci New Mat & Technol, Moscow 105005, Russia; [Kukartsev, Viktor A.] Siberian Fed Univ, Polytech Inst, Dept Mat Sci & Mat Proc Technol, Krasnoyarsk 660041, Russia; [Tynchenko, Yadviga A.] Siberian Fed Univ, Lab Biofuel Composit, Krasnoyarsk 660041, Russia; [Tynchenko, Yadviga A.] Reshetnev Siberian State Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Syst Anal & Operat Res, Krasnoyarsk 660037, Russia";"North Caucasian Institute of Mining & Metallurgy (State Technological University); Tomsk Polytechnic University; Moscow Polytechnic University; Moscow City University; Reshetnev Siberian State University of Science & Technology; Siberian Federal University; Bauman Moscow State Technical University; Siberian Federal University; Siberian Federal University; Reshetnev Siberian State University of Science & Technology";Martyushev, NV (corresponding author), Tomsk Polytech Univ, Dept Adv Technol, 30 Lenin Ave, Tomsk 634050, Russia.;martjushev@tpu.ru;"Kukartsev, Vladislav/U-6956-2019; Klyuev, Roman Vladimirovich/AAX-6549-2021; Savchenko, Irina Aleksandrovna/B-1076-2016; Klyuev, Roman/J-8000-2014; Martyushev, Nikita/AAO-2653-2020";"Kukartsev, Vladislav/0000-0001-6382-1736; Klyuev, Roman Vladimirovich/0000-0003-3777-7203; Klyuev, Roman/0000-0003-3777-7203; Martyushev, Nikita/0000-0003-0620-9561";;;;;47;41;41;29;36;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;2571-6255;;;FIRE-BASEL;Fire-Switzerland;MAR;2023;6;3;;;;;;;95;10.3390/fire6030095;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/fire6030095;;;12;"Ecology; Forestry";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Environmental Sciences & Ecology; Forestry";A5NO5;;Green Published, gold;;;2024-04-12;WOS:000955589000001;View Full Record in Web of Science

RESULTS: It has been investigated how magnesium oxide and cerium oxide interact to affect the crystal structure, morphology and microstructure of the materials produced. It was assumed that CeO2 forms on the surface of MgO while the material's developed surface is preserved. The values of the specific surface area and average pore diameter of the studied samples depend on the composition and vary in the ranges of 16-41 m(2) g(-1) and 11.919 nm, respectively. CONCLUSION: It has been established that the sizes of CeO2 crystallites in the composition of nanocomposites change insignificantly and range from 6.5 to 7.4 nm. The photocatalytic activity of the studied samples is at least two times higher compared to analogs. The samples MgO-CeO2 (30 mol%) and MgO-CeO2 (50 mol%) showed the maximum photodegradation efficiency of acid telon blue and direct bright blue dyes at levels of 98.5% and 92.5%, respectively.

The research is aimed at improving the parameters of the mechanical activation effect produced on technogenic georesources, as well as at expanding the application scope of disintegrators in the field of using the partial backfill of the mined-out space when developing stratified deposits. In this regard, the research purpose was to substantiate the parameters of extracting metals from enrichment tailings using their mechanochemical activation to ensure cyclic waste management. The research involved the application of three-dimensional interpolation methods used for processing the data and the graphical representation. As a result, the following was found to be characteristic of the waste of the Sadonsky mine management. The degree of extracting zinc from pre-activated tailings increases logarithmically when the H2SO4 concentration and the NaCl proportion decrease 3.5 times. The degree of extracting lead from the activated tailings increases according to the Fourier law when decreasing the NaCl mass concentration, and an optimal range of the H2SO4 (0.38-0.51%) proportion decreases six times. One of the key results of the research is the justification of expanding the scope of applying disintegrators in the case of a directed activation influence exerted on the components of the stowing strips. The obtained results expand the understanding of the mechanism of the influence of the mechanochemical activation of dry tailings on the reactivity unevenness when extracting several metals from them.;"[Golik, Vladimir I.; Klyuev, Roman V.] Moscow Polytech Univ, Dept Tech & Technol Min & Oil & Gas Prod, 33 B Semenovskaya St, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Martyushev, Nikita V.] Tomsk Polytech Univ, Mat Sci Dept, 30 Lenin Ave, Tomsk 634050, Russia; [Kondratiev, Viktor V.] Russian Acad Sci, A P Vinogradov Inst Geochem, Lab Geochem Ore Format & Geochem Methods Prospecti, Siberian Branch, Irkutsk 664033, Russia; [Tynchenko, Vadim S.] Siberian Fed Univ, Sch Petr & Nat Gas Engn, Dept Technol Machines & Equipment Oil & Gas Comple, Krasnoyarsk 660041, Russia; [Tynchenko, Vadim S.] Reshetnev Siberian State Univ Sci & Technol, Inst Comp Sci & Telecommun, Informat Control Syst Dept, Krasnoyarsk 660037, Russia; [Tynchenko, Vadim S.] Bauman Moscow State Tech Univ, Artificial Intelligence Technol Sci & Educ Ctr, Moscow 105005, Russia; [Gladkikh, Vitaliy A.] Moscow State Univ Civil Engn, Stroytest Res & Testing Ctr, 26 Yaroslavskoye Shosse, Moscow 129337, Russia; [Iushkova, Liudmila V.] Siberian Fed Univ, Higher Sch Restaurant Management, Basic Dept, Krasnoyarsk 660041, Russia; [Iushkova, Liudmila V.] Minist Emergency Situat Russia, Siberian Fire & Rescue Acad State Fire Serv, Dept State & Municipal Adm, Zheleznogorsk 662972, Russia; [Brigida, Vladimir] RUDN Univ, Dept Biomed Vet & Ecol Direct, 6 Miklukho Maklaya St, Moscow 117198, Russia; [Brigida, Vladimir] Russian Acad Sci, Res Inst Comprehens Exploitat Mineral Resources, 4 Kryukovskiy Tupik, Moscow 111020, Russia";"Moscow Polytechnic University; Tomsk Polytechnic University; Russian Academy of Sciences; Siberian Federal University; Reshetnev Siberian State University of Science & Technology; Bauman Moscow State Technical University; Moscow State University of Civil Engineering; Siberian Federal University; Peoples Friendship University of Russia; Russian Academy of Sciences";Martyushev, NV (corresponding author), Tomsk Polytech Univ, Mat Sci Dept, 30 Lenin Ave, Tomsk 634050, Russia.;"v.i.golik@mail.ru; kluev-roman@rambler.ru; martjushev@tpu.ru; vadimond@mail.ru; 1z011@inbox.ru";"Klyuev, Roman/J-8000-2014; Brigida, Vladimir/G-6933-2018; Klyuev, Roman Vladimirovich/AAX-6549-2021; Gladkikh, Vitaliy/F-1577-2017; Martyushev, Nikita/AAO-2653-2020";"Klyuev, Roman/0000-0003-3777-7203; Brigida, Vladimir/0000-0002-9421-5613; Klyuev, Roman Vladimirovich/0000-0003-3777-7203; Gladkikh, Vitaliy/0000-0003-1953-1584; Martyushev, Nikita/0000-0003-0620-9561";;;;;115;2;2;3;3;MDPI;BASEL;ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND;;1996-1944;;MATERIALS;Materials;NOV;2023;16;21;;;;;;;7004;10.3390/ma16217004;http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ma16217004;;;17;"Chemistry, Physical; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering; Physics, Applied; Physics, Condensed Matter";Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED);"Chemistry; Materials Science; Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering; Physics";X7MG7;37959601;gold, Green Published;;;2024-04-12;WOS:001100241500001;View Full Record in Web of Science

The potentials of NOMA are to increase the number of users, the system's capacity, massive connectivity, and enhance the spectrum and energy efficiency in future communication scenarios. However, the practical deployment of NOMA is hindered by the inflexibility caused by the offline design paradigm and non-unified signal processing approaches of different NOMA schemes. The recent innovations and breakthroughs in deep learning (DL) methods have paved the way to adequately address these challenges. The DL-based NOMA can break these fundamental limits of conventional NOMA in several aspects, including throughput, bit-error-rate (BER), low latency, task scheduling, resource allocation, user pairing and other better performance characteristics. This article aims to provide firsthand knowledge of the prominence of NOMA and DL and surveys several DL-enabled NOMA systems. This study emphasizes Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC), Channel State Information (CSI), impulse noise (IN), channel estimation, power allocation, resource allocation, user fairness and transceiver design, and a few other parameters as key performance indicators of NOMA systems. In addition, we outline the integration of DL-based NOMA with several emerging technologies such as intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS), mobile edge computing (MEC), simultaneous wireless and information power transfer (SWIPT), Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM), and multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO). This study also highlights diverse, significant technical hindrances in DL-based NOMA systems. Finally, we identify some future research directions to shed light on paramount developments needed in existing systems as a probable to invigorate further contributions for DL-based NOMA system.;"[Mohsan, Syed Agha Hassnain; Li, Yanlong] Zhejiang Univ, Ocean Coll, Opt Commun Lab, Zheda Rd 1, Zhoushan 316021, Peoples R China; [Li, Yanlong] Guilin Univ Elect Technol, Key Lab Cognit Radio & Informat Proc, Minist Educ, Guilin 541004, Peoples R China; [Shvetsov, Alexey V.

Carbon-based electrodes, with their characteristic high specific power and good cyclic stability, can be used for a new generation of consumer electronics, biomedical devices and hybrid electric vehicles. However, most carbon materials, due to their low electrical conductivity and insufficient diffusion of electrolyte ions in complex micropores, have energy density limitations in these devices due to insufficient number of pores for electrolyte diffusion. This work focuses on the optimization of a hybrid material based on porous carbon and carbon nanotubes by mechanical mixing. The purpose of this work is to gain new knowledge about the effect of hybrid material composition on its specific capacitance. The material for the study is taken on the basis of porous carbon and carbon nanotubes. Electrodes made of this hybrid material were taken as an object of research. Porous carbon or nitrogen-containing porous carbon (combined with single-, double-, or multi-layer carbon nanotubes (single-layer carbon nanotubes, bilayer carbon nanotubes or multilayer carbon nanotubes) were used to create the hybrid material. The effect of catalytic chemical vapor deposition synthesis parameters, such as flow rate and methane-to-hydrogen ratio, as well as the type of catalytic system on the multilayer carbon nanotubes structure was investigated. Two types of catalysts based on Mo12O28 (& mu;(2)-OH)(12){Co(H2O)(3)}(4) were prepared for the synthesis of multilayer carbon nanotubes by precipitation and combustion. The resulting carbon materials were tested as electrodes for supercapacitors and lithium ion intercalation. Electrodes based on nitrogen-containing porous carbon/carbon nanotubes 95:5% were found to be the most efficient compared to nitrogen-doped porous carbon by 10%. Carbon nanotubes, bilayer carbon nanotubes and multilayer carbon nanotubes synthesized using the catalyst obtained by deposition were selected as additives for the hybrid material. The hybrid materials were obtained by mechanical mixing and dispersion in an aqueous solution followed by lyophilization to remove water.

The presented study aims to develop a model of optimal crop production structure under the existing weather risks in the agricultural management system. The article reviews the basic theoretical concepts in optimizing the production structure of agricultural enterprises, examines the specific features of crop production, proves the influence of weather and climate conditions on forming the production structure, demonstrates the use of correlation and regression analysis for trend modeling and forecasting of crop yields, and offers suggestions for determining the optimal production structure. The study concludes that multivariate forecasting helps optimize management in economic organizations and ensure their development under the variability of natural conditions. Natural and climatic conditions significantly impact the development of production structures in agricultural enterprises, along with nature acting as an innate participant in the game.;"[Shaimerdenova, A.] Kazakh Natl Agr Res Univ, Alma Ata, Kazakhstan; [Agapitova, L.

It is shown that these dyes produce stable floating layers with a certain number of threedimensional aggregates at the air/water interface. The floating layers retain their structure when transferred to a glass substrate by the Langmuir-Schaefer method, demonstrating the H-aggregation of the dyes. In contrast to the initial monohydroxyphthalocyanine 1, thin films of its derivatives, cyclotriphosphazene-substituted monomer 2 and dimer 3, show a slight increase in absorption when the number of deposited layers exceeds 100. It is shown that thin films of the studied dyes 1-3 can be used in the technology of optical limitation of laser radiation, demonstrating a good cutting efficiency of dangerous nanosecond pulses.;"[Kazak, Alexandr, V; Usol'tseva, Nadezhda, V] Ivanovo State Univ, Nanomat Res Inst, Ermak St 39, Ivanovo 153025, Russia; [Kazak, Alexandr, V] Moscow Polytech Univ, Bolshaya Semenovskaya St 38, Moscow 107023, Russia; [Nikitin, Konstantin S.] Russian Acad Sci, GA Krestov Inst Solut Chem, Akademicheskaya St 1, Ivanovo 153045, Russia; [Marchenkova, Margarita A.] Shubnikov Inst Crystallog Fed Sci Res Ctr Crystall, Leninskii Pr 59, Moscow 119333, Russia; [Marchenkova, Margarita A.] Natl Res Ctr Kurchatov Inst, Academika Kurchatova Sq 1, Moscow 123182, Russia; [Savelyev, Mikhail S.; Vasilevsky, Pavel N.; Gerasimenko, Alexander Yu.] Natl Res Univ Elect Technol MIET, Shokin Sq, Zelenograd 124498, Moscow, Russia; [Savelyev, Mikhail S.; Gerasimenko, Alexander Yu.] IM Sechenov First Moscow State Med Univ, Bolshaya Pirogovskaya St,Bld 2-4, Moscow 119991, Russia; [Savelyev, Mikhail S.; Vasilevsky, Pavel N.; Tolbin, Alexander Yu.] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Physiol Act Cpds Fed Res Ctr Problems Chem Ph, Chernogolovka 142432, Russia; [Chausov, Denis N.] Russian Acad Sci, Prokhorov Gen Phys Inst, Vavilova St 38, Moscow 119991, Russia; [Chausov, Denis N.] Moscow Univ Ind & Finance Synergy, Leningrad Pr 80, Moscow 125190, Russia; [Kholodkov, Igor, V] Ivanovo State Univ Chem & Technol, Inst Macroheterocycl Cpds, Sheremetevsky Av 7, Ivanovo 153000, Russia";"Ivanovo State University; Moscow Polytechnic University; Russian Academy of Sciences; G.
